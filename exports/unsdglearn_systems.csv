The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is unprecedented in its scope and ambition. The UN and governments have neither the reach nor the resources to implement it alone. Engagement, especially with the private sector, is imperative for the 2030 Agenda to succeed.
The private sector with its unparalleled reach has the capacity to be a key driver to achieve the objectives of the 2030 Agenda and in some cases is already performing this role. The UN and its member states must seize the opportunity to form strategic partnerships with private sector entities and advocate for businesses to embrace sustainable development in order to achieve the 2030 Agenda.
Moreover, the 2030 Agenda offers the private sector numerous opportunities to access new markets and institutional investment, estimated at about $12 trillion by 2030 while adding 380 million new jobs. This in itself is a compelling argument for the private sector and governments to work together to make the 2030 Agenda a reality.

They contribute to good governance and to improving the lives of citizens. Engaging citizens and fostering partnership with civil society can help them enhance the value of public oversight, strengthen the legitimacy of audit processes as well as SAIs’ independence. This course delves into the political economy of SAI-citizen engagement and offers tools to inform communication strategies and advance public participation at different stages of the audit cycle.
Over the past decade, SAIs around the world have started to deepen their engagement with citizens to increase the effectiveness and scope of their auditing practices. These efforts include pioneering various citizen engagement models to increase the effectiveness of the audit process and the effect of SAIs’ work to enhance value in the use of public resources.
The challenges as well as the opportunities for effective engagement between SAIs and citizens are many raising questions, such as, how can space be opened for SAIs and citizens to interact to enhance external oversight through greater participation, transparency, and accountability? Also, how can the tools and mechanisms be created for SAIs and citizens to interact and jointly work toward improving the audit process? Answering those questions is at the core of this e-learning course, which tries to address them in a practical, simple way while reinforcing the growing consensus regarding benefits that the collaboration brings.
In this course we will learn different tools to design participatory policies, measure short and long-term outcomes, and assess the overall performance and impact of citizen engagement interventions, through interactive multimedia presentations, practice exercises and quizzes.

It is the first time Statistics Norway har transferred a course of this size to video. The aim is to make the experiences and theory from the face to face training we do internally and externally available to anyone, anywhere.
The lectures provide theoretical background mixed with examples from Norway and from work with other countries and organisations. Our aim is to contribute to improved questionnaires, leading to official statistics that is relevant and of best possible quality. The course is focussing on interviews with individuals and households, but most of the theory is the same for surveys covering businesses and other organisations.
The following topics are covered:
 1 Key concepts
This module contains an introduction to central concepts used in the rest of the course.
2 Specification
The specification module covers defining the central concepts to be investigated in the questionnaire, identifying the clients’ information needs and investigating respondents’ information availability.
3 Operationalisation
Operationalisation is to turn the topic we want to investigate into well-functioning questions and answers. The first lecture begins with key considerations and moves on to response options. The second lecture looks at questions, instructions and functionality.
4 Design
The design module covers why question order matter and how to develop optimal order, advice for visual design and use of instructions.
5 Testing
The course introduces four methods of testing questionnaires: Expert appraisals, cognitive interviews, behaviour coding and focus groups.
 
The lectures are found at an open Vimeo page. They have been used to undertake workshops mixing video with hands-on work on assignments, both face to face and through webinars. Work is being done to integrate the videos in a more comprehensive online course with assignments. References to materials in the lectures apply only for this version, which will also be free for all and available through this portal.

PPIs measure price change from the perspective of the seller. This contrasts with other measures, such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) which measures price change from the purchaser’s perspective. Sellers’ and purchasers’ prices may differ due to government subsides, sales and excise taxes, and distribution costs.
Producer Price Index data are widely used by the business community as well as government. Three major uses are:
As an economic indicator. The PPIs capture price movements prior to the retail level. Therefore, they may foreshadow subsequent price changes for businesses and consumers. National leaders and central banks employ these data in formulating fiscal and monetary policies.
As a deflator of other economic series. PPIs are used to adjust other economic time series for price changes and to translate those series into inflation-free currency values. For example, constant-dollar gross domestic product data are estimated using deflators based on PPI data.
As the basis for contract escalation. PPI data are commonly used in escalating purchase and sales contracts. These contracts typically specify cost amounts to be paid at some point in the future. It is often desirable to include an escalation clause that accounts for increases in input prices. (See BLS Report 807, Escalation and Producer Price Indexes: A Guide for Contracting Parties.)
Import and Export Price Indexes (MXP) are a family of indexes that measure the average change over time in the prices of nonmilitary goods and services traded between the domestic country and the rest of the world. The MXPs help to answer the question “how will trade affect the production of goods and services in the economy?” and are primarily used to deflate various foreign trade statistics.
Participants are encouraged to bring with them the following materials for use in discussions and workshops: 1) methodological documentation on how data related to the seminar topic are collected in their home countries; 2) questionnaires used in their countries for obtaining those data; and 3) sample publications of those data.
The seminar includes discussions on the following topics:
Producer Price Indexes (PPI) and Import and Export Price Indexes (MXP)
Conceptual framework
Target population
Sampling and weighting techniques
Selection of sample items and establishments
Development of specifications
Collection and processing of data
Construction of index numbers
Seasonal items and other special problem areas
Quality adjustments
Data collection and conceptual problems in the informal sector
Publication, presentation, and dissemination of data
Uses of price index data
Application of price index data in other countries
Techniques for analyzing data on prices and expenditures
Analysis of selected statistical tools and techniques
Use of price indexes as a deflator in the GDP
Use of price indexes as a deflator for trade statistics
Analysis of the ways in which price changes impact real wages and purchasing power

As of August 2017, 152 Parties to the Convention out of 197 have submitted their first Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to the UNFCCC, with 102 including an adaptation component, the majority being developing countries. The UNFCCC report released in October 2016 on progress in the process of formulating and implementing National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) indicates that many more countries, including over 80% of Least Developed Countries (LDCs), have embarked on developing a NAP.
The development and implementation of NAPs involve decisions related to climate risk management, which require reliable, relevant, usable and timely climate information.
Climate information used within the NAP process encompasses a wide range of information on past, present and future climate, and products which help improve the understanding of climate and its impacts on natural and human systems and support decisions to improve climate-related outcomes. Climate services involve the production, translation, transfer and use of climate knowledge and information for this purpose. Climate services, therefore, play a crucial role in the planning, financing and implementation of adaptation to climate change.
In this context and drawing on the WMO-led Global Framework for Climate Services (GFCS), WMO and UNITAR developed capacity building e-learning materials in support of a wider training package on “Integration Climate Risk Information into National Adaptation Planning”. The aim of this e-learning component is to contribute to capacity building that will bridge the information and communication gaps currently affecting the demand for climate information services and their supply.

The course is designed to respond the learning needs of both climate services providers (National Hydro-meteorological Services, research/academic and international organizations), and users (e.g. decision makers, private investors, non-governmental organizations, etc.), as well as of those working at the science-policy interface for outreach or communication purposes.
The training is modular  and provides you with the liberty to  choose and combine different thematic modules. There are two main themes or learning tracks available as illustrated in the figure below.
Learning track 1 (green-colored): Producing climate information for NAPs
Learning track 2 (yellow-colored): Using climate information for NAPs
Both learning tracks have in common the Intro and Wrap-up modules.
How to choose the learning track that best suits your profile and learning needs?
Once you complete the Intro module, you are recommended to undertake a test. Based on your answers to the five questions of the test you will be advised to follow either learning track 1 or 2, or both.
Each learning track culminates with a quiz that will assess the knowledge you will acquire. If you pass the quiz with a minimum mark of 70%, a certificate of completion will be issued to you. If you choose to follow both learning tracks you can receive two certificates by passing both quizzes.

									, Further to the adoption of the 2030 Agenda in September 2015, 4 rounds of reviews of its implementation took place at the global level in July 2016, July 2017, July 2018 and July 2019 in the context of the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). More than 100 countries have already presented their Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) at HLPF. All UN Member States are expected to conduct regular and inclusive national reviews of progress on the SDGs and contribute to regional and global reviews. Such reviews should draw on national processes and include contributions from different stakeholders., This e-learning course is designed to support this process and is aimed at strengthening the capacities of Governments to engage in an effective and meaningful way with MGoS (Major Groups and other stakeholders) as they implement and review progress towards the achievement of the SDGs. It complements a range of other capacity development activities being rolled out, among other, by UN Secretariat to meet the needs of both governments and other stakeholders with regards to the 2030 Agenda and HLPF process., The course is composed of two parts: Fundamentals of stakeholder engagement and InFocus modules., Fundamentals, Module 1. Understanding the need for stakeholder engagement in the 2030 Agenda at the national level, Module 2.

Economic information helps a wide array of people assess how well an economy is performing and guides decision-making. What are economic indicators? What is their significance? How should they be interpreted? This seminar is an introduction to key economic indicators and how they are used. In depth discussion on how to construct the various indicators is not provided in this seminar.
The following BLS economic indicators and topics will be presented in this seminar:
Employment and Unemployment
Data on employed persons and the unemployment rate provide a vital snapshot of the strength of a labor market. A range of measures of labor underutilization and other employment data produced by BLS will also be discussed.
Wages and Labor Costs
Wages, earnings, and benefits account for a substantial part of a country’s national income and are closely linked to the economic cycle. Determining levels and trends of pay rates by occupation, industry, locality, and region is important in the analysis of current economic developments. The seminar will also discuss indexes that measure the change over time in labor costs (Employment Cost Index) and data measuring the level of average costs per hour worked (Employer Costs for Employee Compensation).
Prices
Price indexes, indicators of the rates of inflation in a country’s economy, also serve as a tool for adjusting wages, salaries, and other income payments to keep in step with rising prices. The seminar will address the importance of Consumer Price Indexes, Producer Price Indexes, and Import and Export Price Indexes.
Productivity and Unit Labor Costs
Productivity is one of the major determinants of the standard of living, since increases in productivity can result in higher real income and increased price stability. Measures of productivity and unit labor costs are important signals of international competitiveness.
 
Data discussed in this seminar are used to report on the following SDG indicators:
Indicator 5.4.1: Proportion of time spent on unpaid domestic and care work, by sex, age and location
Indicator 8.2.1: Annual growth rate of real GDP per employed person
Indicator 8.5.1: Average hourly earnings of female and male employees, by occupation, age and persons with disabilities
Indicator 8.5.2: Unemployment rate, by sex, age and persons with disabilities
Indicator 8.6.1: Proportion of youth (aged 15–24 years) not in education, employment or training
Indicator 9.2.2: Manufacturing employment as a proportion of total employment

National and local governments need labor market information to reduce unemployment, generate employment, and plan training programs to meet the needs of industry. It is also used in determining future workforce training needs, identifying the availability of labor, ascertaining prevailing wage rates, and exploring potential markets. Labor market information is valuable to local and regional planning agencies as well as industries and businesses looking for site locations, seeking ways of attracting and retaining skilled workers, or assessing the scope and size of potential markets. Labor unions find this information useful for determining comparable wage and compensation levels, local working conditions, and training needs. Investors, educators, workers, and job seekers also benefit from timely and reliable labor market information to help them make sound decisions.
This seminar will show participants how to develop labor market information using data collected from households. “Household” data pertain to individuals and relate to where they reside. Household labor force surveys allow for the collection of comprehensive demographic data on the labor force such as age, sex, race, family relationship, marital status, occupation, and industry attachment. Household labor force surveys can also provide important information about members of the population who are not in the labor force.
Participants are encouraged to bring with them the following materials for use in discussions and workshops: 1) methodological documentation on how data related to the seminar topic are collected in their home countries; 2) questionnaires used in their countries for obtaining those data; and 3) sample publications of those data.
The seminar includes discussions on the following topics:
Introduction to labor markets
What they are and how they are defined
Reasons for conducting labor force surveys
Understanding components of the population
Who is in the labor force? Who is not in the labor force?
Employment status: Who is employed? Who is unemployed?
Employment to population ratio

Household labor force survey data, along with data from other sources, are used to report on the following SDG indicators:
Indicator 5.4.1: Proportion of time spent on unpaid domestic and care work, by sex, age and location
Indicator 8.5.1: Average hourly earnings of female and male employees, by occupation, age and persons with disabilities
Indicator 8.5.2: Unemployment rate, by sex, age and persons with disabilities
Indicator 8.6.1: Proportion of youth (aged 15–24 years) not in education, employment or training
Indicator 9.2.2: Manufacturing employment as a proportion of total employment
, Labor market information is essential for tracking and analyzing the economy of a country. National and local governments need labor market information to reduce unemployment, generate employment, and plan training programs to meet the needs of industry. It is also used in determining future workforce training needs, identifying the availability of labor, ascertaining prevailing wage rates, and exploring potential markets. Labor market information is valuable to local and regional planning agencies as well as industries and businesses looking for site locations, seeking ways of attracting and retaining skilled workers, or assessing the scope and size of potential markets. Labor unions find this information useful for determining comparable wage and compensation levels, local working conditions, and training needs. Investors, educators, workers, and job seekers also benefit from timely and reliable labor market information to help them make sound decisions., This seminar will show participants how to develop labor market information using data collected from households. “Household” data pertain to individuals and relate to where they reside. Household labor force surveys allow for the collection of comprehensive demographic data on the labor force such as age, sex, race, family relationship, marital status, occupation, and industry attachment. Household labor force surveys can also provide important information about members of the population who are not in the labor force., Participants are encouraged to bring with them the following materials for use in discussions and workshops: 1) methodological documentation on how data related to the seminar topic are collected in their home countries; 2) questionnaires used in their countries for obtaining those data; and 3) sample publications of those data., The seminar includes discussions on the following topics:, Introduction to labor markets, Understanding components of the population, Designing and conducting household labor force surveys, Data analysis and dissemination,  , Household labor force survey data, along with data from other sources, are used to report on the following SDG indicators:, 
					Target audience
					This seminar is designed for economists, statisticians, researchers, analysts, and other professionals working with labor market information in national statistical programs. Participants should have an elementary knowledge of statistics and some experience in analyzing labor or economic data.

Just as questionnaires are the means for observing reality through surveys, electronic platforms have the same role for big data. Most of the big data sources offer a non-probabilistic sample of the population of study, where several errors are induced by self-selection of individuals present on the sample, targeting decisions from the owners of the electronic platform and limitations of the coverage of said platform.
In this course you will learn about the principal techniques for correcting bias through a statistical approach. This work is based on previous research work from Data-Pop Alliance on correcting bias on mobile network data and a fundamental book published by Eurostat.
Subject matter
The use of Big Data is accelerating within the development and humanitarian practice. If used right, its implementation can foster inclusion, efficiency, and lower project costs which may benefit public and private organizations involved on development programs. Therefore, our technical courses cover different aspects on data science and data engineering relevant for the context of official statistics and sustainable development.
Methodology
All the programing material is provided in Python using the conventional Open Source libraries for Data Science.  Most of the sessions are interactive and on a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb). A practical exercise is completed at the end of each session.
Format and instructors
This course is offered face-to-face (or via videoconference if necessary), it has a duration of 18 hours ideally distributed along 3 days, and is designed for 20 participants. Each course is delivered by a team of 2 training specialists.
Requirements
Some programming experience is required; Python is preferable though not necessary.
Syllabus
A. Main challenges of big data as an statistical source
We define a statistical approach to big data and highlight the main challenges and opportunities it presents when trying to use it as a statistical source. We go through the specific difficulties of different big data sources of interest such as mobile network data, bank transactional data and social media among others.
B. Unit-level methods for correcting bias
Correcting selection bias in big data can be analogue to procedures used in other data sources which have the same problem of non-random selection and had been studied for a while: web or telephone opt-in surveys.
We will go through different techniques for correcting selectivity bias at the unit of observation level, which most often will be individuals. Even if methods are analogue to those used in opt-in surveys, what you will learn in this course is how to use those procedures in massive data, by leveraging big data frameworks such as Spark, through its easy-to-use Python API: PySpark.
C. Domain-level methods for correcting bias
Correcting selection bias in big data can be analogue to procedures used in other data sources which have the same problem of non-random selection and had been studied for a while: web or telephone opt-in surveys.
We will go through different techniques for correcting selectivity bias at the domain level, which most often will be individuals. Even if methods are analogue to those used in opt-in surveys, what you will learn in this course is how to use those procedures in massive data, by leveraging big data frameworks such as Spark, through its easy-to-use Python API: PySpark.

Testimonial from a participant “The whole course was excellent. It is great having the opportunity to participate in qualifications on modern issues relevant to our work”.
Syllabus
A. Collecting through web browser emulator
Modern websites usually have interactive components. We focus on using web browser emulators, namely Selenium web driver, for exploiting those components programmatically.
The use-case of this module is a real-estate rental platform, where rent prices are collected.
The collection methods used for this platform are applicable for several e-commerce websites which present a similar catalogue structure for exhibiting their products.
B. Collecting through API’s
Large and medium size web platforms commonly expose their data through web Application Programming Interfaces (API’s). We learn how those can be easily manipulated through general open source libraries as requests or dedicated libraries in the case of large platforms as Facebook with the Facebook Marketing SDK official library.
The Facebook modules were inspired on the amazing work done by our colleagues from Qatar Computing Research Institute at HBKU, UNICEF, MIT Media Lab, iMMAP Colombia and the Global Protection Cluster from UNHCR, entitled “Real-Time Monitoring of the Venezuelan Exodus through Facebook’s Advertising Platform” (see publication here).
C. Analyzing and visualizing web derived data
The analysis of web collected data is challenging because this data is frequently noisy and biased. We study how these challenges can be addressed by adequate modeling techniques. Additionally, visualizing as a means for extracting knowledge from data, is also fundamental when treating with web collected data.
We cover some basic cleaning procedures, different Machine Learning models and also static and interactive visualizations. Everything using the most popular Open Source libraries from Python Data-Science stack.

Skills in Machine Learning (ML) are ubiquitous for 21st century statisticians or Data Scientists. In this course you will be introduced to this field of science by covering the most popular tasks from supervised and unsupervised ML.
Motivated by the fact that remote-sensing imagery is already being used to address development issues, i.e. revealing changes in soil quality or water availability, informing agricultural interventions and even measuring poverty; we structured this course around ML methods which can be applied to satellite imagery, aiming to help statistical teams to leverage this modern and omnipresent data source.
Subject matter
The use of Big Data is accelerating within the development and humanitarian practice. If used right, its implementation can foster inclusion, efficiency, and lower project costs which may benefit public and private organizations involved on development programs. Therefore, our technical courses cover different aspects on data science and data engineering relevant for the context of official statistics and sustainable development.

Syllabus
A. Introduction to supervised Machine Learning
Methods from supervised machine learning are those which have progressed more in both academic and industrial environments. We cover the task of classification, training a model for being able to categorize the observations we give to it. We examine algorithms as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Gradient Boosted Trees and Neural Networks going though its theoretical basis and applying them in practice.
B. Introduction to unsupervised Machine Learning
Unsupervised machine learning is currently the second most popular area of the field. We will cover the task of clustering, forming groups of observations which are similar in a previously defined sense. We will go through the theoretical principles and we will put in practice different algorithms such as k-means, Gaussian Mixture Model and others, which are popular in the field of computer vision.
C. Case study: Satellite imagery for measuring urban extent (SDG 11.3.1)
This case-study is developed with Landsat 8 satellite images, which are free and accessible for everyone. Both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods presented previously will be used to be able to infer urban extent from open satellite images, as part of the calculation of the SDG  11.3.1 (Tier 2).
We focus this exercise in using satellite imagery to bridge data gaps in measuring SDG the mentioned Tier 2 indicator, this means it is “conceptually clear, has an internationally established methodology and standards are available, but for which data is not regularly produced by countries”.

Some programming experience is required; Python is preferable though not necessary., Syllabus, A. Introduction to supervised Machine Learning, Methods from supervised machine learning are those which have progressed more in both academic and industrial environments. We cover the task of classification, training a model for being able to categorize the observations we give to it. We examine algorithms as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Gradient Boosted Trees and Neural Networks going though its theoretical basis and applying them in practice., B. Introduction to unsupervised Machine Learning, Unsupervised machine learning is currently the second most popular area of the field. We will cover the task of clustering, forming groups of observations which are similar in a previously defined sense. We will go through the theoretical principles and we will put in practice different algorithms such as k-means, Gaussian Mixture Model and others, which are popular in the field of computer vision., C. Case study: Satellite imagery for measuring urban extent (SDG 11.3.1), This case-study is developed with Landsat 8 satellite images, which are free and accessible for everyone. Both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods presented previously will be used to be able to infer urban extent from open satellite images, as part of the calculation of the SDG  11.3.1 (Tier 2)., We focus this exercise in using satellite imagery to bridge data gaps in measuring SDG the mentioned Tier 2 indicator, this means it is “conceptually clear, has an internationally established methodology and standards are available, but for which data is not regularly produced by countries”.,  ,
