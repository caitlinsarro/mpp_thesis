SIDS are disproportionately exposed and vulnerable to natural hazards. In additional, climate change is poised to increase the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, storm surges, extreme winds, and flooding.
When disaster strikes, damage to transport infrastructure typically accounts for a large portion of economic losses, resulting in heavy fiscal strains on SIDS’ small economies and social burden.  As a consequence, to physical damage to the infrastructure, transport disruptions can cripple key economic sectors like tourism, fishing, or agriculture, and cut off access to healthcare, education, and other essential services. Damage to critical assets like roads, ports or airports also impedes disaster response and recovery operations, further increasing the overall vulnerability of communities living in SIDS. 
Enhancing transport resilience brings significant benefits to SIDS by reducing losses in both assets and well-being. There is a need to improve the management of transport assets and to plan for growing risks. In the face of a changing climate, disasters risk needs to be taken into consideration at all stages of the infrastructure lifecycle, from the planning phase to engineering designs, operations, maintenance, and contingency programming.

In the face of a changing climate, disasters risk needs to be taken into consideration at all stages of the infrastructure lifecycle, from the planning phase to engineering designs, operations, maintenance, and contingency programming. 
The World Bank is committed in supporting client countries to strengthen their institutional capacity and systems by enhancing resilience to the impacts of climate change and disasters. The course aims to provide strategic, experiential, and practical knowledge on how to integrate climate and disaster risk considerations in the management of transport assets in Small Island Developing States.
The course provides a holistic overview of Transport Asset Management Systems and a framework for integrating climate and disaster risk considerations. This will enable task teams and country counterparts to identify opportunities to enhance transport asset management systems and investment project identification, preparation and implementation., Topics: Asset Management, Disaster Risk Management, Resilient Infrastructure, Resilient infrastructure and transport, Transport, Regions: Africa, East Asia and Pacific, Latin America & Caribbean, GP: Transport, Keywords: Asset Management Systems, GFDRR, SIDS, Small Island Developing States, Transport, Climate, Disaster, Islands, Risk, Climate Resilient Transport in Small Island Developing States (Self-Paced), Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are a group of countries located across the world in the Caribbean, Pacific, Africa, and Indian Ocean regions. SIDS are disproportionately exposed and vulnerable to natural hazards. In additional, climate change is poised to increase the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, storm surges, extreme winds, and flooding.
When disaster strikes, damage to transport infrastructure typically accounts for a large portion of economic losses, resulting in heavy fiscal strains on SIDS’ small economies and social burden.  As a consequence, to physical damage to the infrastructure, transport disruptions can cripple key economic sectors like tourism, fishing, or agriculture, and cut off access to healthcare, education, and other essential services. Damage to critical assets like roads, ports or airports also impedes disaster response and recovery operations, further increasing the overall vulnerability of communities living in SIDS.

Enhancing transport resilience brings significant benefits to SIDS by reducing losses in both assets and well-being. There is a need to improve the management of transport assets and to plan for growing risks. In the face of a changing climate, disasters risk needs to be taken into consideration at all stages of the infrastructure lifecycle, from the planning phase to engineering designs, operations, maintenance, and contingency programming. 
The World Bank is committed in supporting client countries to strengthen their institutional capacity and systems by enhancing resilience to the impacts of climate change and disasters. The course aims to provide strategic, experiential, and practical knowledge on how to integrate climate and disaster risk considerations in the management of transport assets in Small Island Developing States.
The course provides a holistic overview of Transport Asset Management Systems and a framework for integrating climate and disaster risk considerations. This will enable task teams and country counterparts to identify opportunities to enhance transport asset management systems and investment project identification, preparation and implementation., Topics: Asset Management, Disaster Risk Management, Resilient Infrastructure, Resilient infrastructure and transport, Transport, Regions: Africa, East Asia and Pacific, Latin America & Caribbean, GP: Transport, Keywords: Asset Management Systems, GFDRR, SIDS, Small Island Developing States, Transport, Climate, Disaster, Islands, Risk, Climate Resilient Transport in Small Island Developing States (Self-Paced), Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are a group of countries located across the world in the Caribbean, Pacific, Africa, and Indian Ocean regions. SIDS are disproportionately exposed and vulnerable to natural hazards. In additional, climate change is poised to increase the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, storm surges, extreme winds, and flooding.
When disaster strikes, damage to transport infrastructure typically accounts for a large portion of economic losses, resulting in heavy fiscal strains on SIDS’ small economies and social burden.  As a consequence, to physical damage to the infrastructure, transport disruptions can cripple key economic sectors like tourism, fishing, or agriculture, and cut off access to healthcare, education, and other essential services. Damage to critical assets like roads, ports or airports also impedes disaster response and recovery operations, further increasing the overall vulnerability of communities living in SIDS.

2. critically analyze the sustainable development goals (sdgs) and their relationship to the world’s most pressing problems.
3. use frameworks and evidence necessary to develop solutions.
4. assess relevant solutions that would help realize the sdgs and at the same time solve the pressing problems. 
5. apply skills learned to implement solutions.","  university of michigan"," global","https://olc.worldbank.org/content/elearning-course-passive-urban-cooling-solutions","eLearning course on Passive Urban Cooling Solutions, The course will be based on the Primer and presented as a series of four modules:
(1) Introducing Urban Heat and its Effects: The module will introduce the concept of rising urban temperatures as a key resiliency challenge for cities. It will explore the current macro-trends driving urban heat and the nature and causes of the urban heat island phenomenon.  The module will also review heat’s wide-ranging negative effects on urban systems and populations.
(2) Technical Solutions to Urban Heat and Barriers to Implementing Them: This module will introduce the concept of passive and active urban cooling and present a series of technical solutions to facilitate passive urban cooling.  The module also explores the unique barriers to implementing technical passive urban cooling solutions that have slowed wide-scale adoption of these solutions in both the developed and developing world.
(3) Designing, Adopting and Implementing Policies to Cool Cities: This module will focus on how cities can develop effective policies and programs to implement technical passive urban cooling solutions.  The module articulates a framework to encourage an inclusive, multi-stakeholder policy development process that incorporates multiple technical urban cooling solutions and establishes measurable goals.  The module highlights and categorizes existing urban cooling policies implemented by cities around the world.  Finally, the module reviews how these policies and programs are financed, with recommendations for how cities can increase the availability of funding and financing to support urban cooling efforts.
(4) Summary of Recommendations: This module concludes the eLearning Course with general recommendations to develop and implement passive urban cooling solutions and policies, drawn from some of the common good practices adopted by cities from around the world.
