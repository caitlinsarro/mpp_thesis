"64",64,"Planning for Climate Change in African Cities","reflexivity and adaptation","Climate change poses a threat to economic growth and long-term prosperity of many countries around the world. Africa is not an exception, considering the actual and potential impacts of climate change and climate variability that will threaten its vulnerable sectors and human populations. African countries are projected to experience changing rainfall patterns, rising sea levels, and higher temperatures that will affect food security, agricultural production, water availability, and public health, among others. These climate change impacts and climate variability can further produce social and political problems, such as rural-urban migration and water resource disputes.   , Furthermore, the low levels of development in many African countries, as well as limited institutional, infrastructural, and technical capacities to respond successfully to climate change impacts and climate variability, can exacerbate the situation. In terms of contribution to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, although African countries are the lightest polluters, it has also become apparent that alternative energy sources can offset the increasing energy demand and dependence on biomass. Addressing climate change offers possibilities for low-carbon development. Moreover, there are promising mechanisms that can address both climate change actions and development goals simultaneously. 

At the city level, strengthening resilience, or the ability to respond to and absorb the effects of a hazardous event in a timely and efficient manner and to sustain this ability in the future, and adaptation; the process of adjusting to actual or expected climate change stimuli or their effects, should be at the forefront of planning.  Local governments have an important role to play through the provision of adequate infrastructure, regulation of land use, and other public services that are crucial for urban resilience. Mobilizing local governments, in collaboration with national governments, non-governmental organizations, and international organizations, among others, is also critical for an integrated multi-sectoral approach to climate change. 

The Course on Planning for Climate Change in African Cities provides the foundation for understanding cities  exposure and sensitivity to climate change, and how cities can manage these impacts in the face of growing uncertainty. It does so by introducing the basic concepts of urban resilience and adaptation, by using illustrative case studies in different African cities. Furthermore, this module provides lectures on the different approaches for climate change planning, whether ad hoc, strategic or mainstreaming; introduces the different steps in the planning cycle   from initial assessment to monitoring and evaluation; and presents the different decision support and assessment tools for prioritizing climate change actions. This course broadens the discussion on planning for climate change by engaging learners to apply their knowledge and practice their decision-making skills in a simulated exercise.

In line with development that minimizes the harm caused by climate change impacts, while maximizing the many human development opportunities presented by a more resilient future, we ask: what are the connections between urban risk and vulnerability? How is climate change and urban resilience conceptualized and applied in practice? Which policies and measures should be introduced to address climate change? Finally, how to choose among different measures that address climate change adaptation, urban resilience, and other development objectives? 

Course Objectives:
At the end of this course, learners should be able to:

 	Recognize the effects, impacts, and drivers of climate change in cities

This MOOC is at the junction between the development of Southern countries and sustainable development. 
It has: 
1) a macroeconomic and financial dimension, developed by Gael Giraud and Alain Grandjean; 
2) an ecological and climatic dimension, developed by David Claessen and ENS speakers; and 
3) a focus on Southern countries, developed by AFD speakers.

Here are the learning goals for the entire training program:

Goal 1: Be able to understand the relationship between the energy transition, the ecological transition, the role of energy in our economy, our economic development model, and financing issues. 
Goal 2: Know how to advocate for and lobby on issues and on the need to change reality in order to implement strategies and action plans.
Goal 3: Be able to make a link between the Energy transition and financing solutions, and between comprehension and action.  
No one questions the imperative need to ensure development based on personal well-being and a fair distribution of wealth.

The Challenges of a Transition for All  
Until now the development of Northern countries has been based on an increasing exploitation of energy resources and a greater freedom of trade and exchange at the global scale. We now know that such a model is no longer sustainable, due to global warming and to the overexploitation of resources, which lead to health, social, and environmental disasters.

The Role of Developing Countries
With that in mind, how can we ensure fair and equitable growth for all? What role do countries from the different regions in the South have to play in this complete upheaval of the current economic, trade, and political models in order to achieve an effective energy and ecological transition?
  
A MOOC to Respond to these Questions
This free online training offers complementary perspectives from several specialists of issues related to climate change and the development of Southern countries. They will share their very practical understanding of the current crises and the answers that can be provided. Participants will learn from studies by:
  Researchers from the prestigious  cole Normale Sup rieure in Paris
  Field experts from the Agence Fran aise de D veloppement, a funding agency that has been committed to helping developing countries for 75 years,
  Carbone 4 founder Alain Grandjean, who will share his experience, in particular on the economic and financial aspects.
 
Here is the program: 
1.       Our development model is ecologically unsustainable
2.       The dominant economic models hinder the energy and ecological transition
3.       The energy transition path: decarbonizing GDP
4.       The model of an ecological transition to new prosperity
5.       Governance of the energy and ecological transition
6.       Financing the energy and ecological transition",3

This course explores social protection as it applies to sustainable development, the 2030 Agenda, and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
Social protection is a key element of national strategies to promote human development, political stability, and inclusive growth. Currently, an estimated 53 per cent of the world s population lives without any form of social protection.
Social protection is more relevant than ever to address social and economic impact during and after the unfolding health emergency. The pandemic has illuminated both the gaps and advantages of access to national health care systems and the implementation of policies to support income security.
The ambitious objectives set out in the 2030 Agenda and the unprecedented social protection requirements related to COVID-19 will involve concerted efforts from across the spectrum of UN and national actors, linking interventions and leveraging new tools to build universal social protection programmes and achieve the 2030 Agenda promise of life in dignity and prosperity on a healthy planet.

As of August 2017, 152 Parties to the Convention out of 197 have submitted their first Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to the UNFCCC, with 102 including an adaptation component, the majority being developing countries. The UNFCCC report released in October 2016 on progress in the process of formulating and implementing National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) indicates that many more countries, including over 80% of Least Developed Countries (LDCs), have embarked on developing a NAP.
The development and implementation of NAPs involve decisions related to climate risk management, which require reliable, relevant, usable and timely climate information.
Climate information used within the NAP process encompasses a wide range of information on past, present and future climate, and products which help improve the understanding of climate and its impacts on natural and human systems and support decisions to improve climate-related outcomes. Climate services involve the production, translation, transfer and use of climate knowledge and information for this purpose. Climate services, therefore, play a crucial role in the planning, financing and implementation of adaptation to climate change.
In this context and drawing on the WMO-led Global Framework for Climate Services (GFCS), WMO and UNITAR developed capacity building e-learning materials in support of a wider training package on  Integration Climate Risk Information into National Adaptation Planning . The aim of this e-learning component is to contribute to capacity building that will bridge the information and communication gaps currently affecting the demand for climate information services and their supply.

The course is designed to respond the learning needs of both climate services providers (National Hydro-meteorological Services, research/academic and international organizations), and users (e.g. decision makers, private investors, non-governmental organizations, etc.), as well as of those working at the science-policy interface for outreach or communication purposes.
The training is modular  and provides you with the liberty to  choose and combine different thematic modules. There are two main themes or learning tracks available as illustrated in the figure below.
Learning track 1 (green-colored): Producing climate information for NAPs
Learning track 2 (yellow-colored): Using climate information for NAPs
Both learning tracks have in common the Intro and Wrap-up modules.
How to choose the learning track that best suits your profile and learning needs?
Once you complete the Intro module, you are recommended to undertake a test. Based on your answers to the five questions of the test you will be advised to follow either learning track 1 or 2, or both.
Each learning track culminates with a quiz that will assess the knowledge you will acquire. If you pass the quiz with a minimum mark of 70%, a certificate of completion will be issued to you. If you choose to follow both learning tracks you can receive two certificates by passing both quizzes.

"121",121,"Financing in Health","democratic institutions","Results Based Financing (RBF) for Health is an interactive course that includes narrated presentations, discussion forums, group work and a quiz for each module to assess your knowledge.
The course is based on materials developed over the course of several years for the delivery of face-to-face RBF learning events, which generated a rich repository of knowledge. That knowledge has been translated into e-learning modules to reach a critical mass of health practitioners globally. The course aims to equip  with specific knowledge to help determine whether RBF is an appropriate tool for their context and if so, what type of RBF approach may be appropriate to adopt.
The e-learning course is supported by funding from the Health Results Innovation Trust Fund (HRITF). Since 2007, HRITF has been pioneering RBF programs, with a particular focus on improving maternal and child health outcomes to accelerate progress towards Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 1c, 4 and 5. Learn more: www.rbfhealth.org or www.facebook.com/RBFhealth and www.twitter.com/RBFhealth.
Please take a moment to listen to the course introduction by Petra Vergeer, who is one of the main coordinators of this e-learning course and who helped develop and taught the material in this course in its face-to-face version.
Course context
Traditionally, government and donor funds to improve health service delivery have concentrated on increasing critical inputs, such as infrastructure, equipment, supplies, drugs and vaccines. Since the adoption of the Millennium Declaration in 2000, this development assistance for health has more than doubled. And yet the increase in investments has not translated into the expected health outcomes in low and middle income countries. The challenge these countries face is unequal access and utilization of essential health services, often due to low quality of services, inefficient delivery of services and limited management capacity. In addition, poor households in many countries face impoverishment due to limited financial protection in the health system. Consequently, many countries, especially those in Africa, risk not achieving the MDGs for maternal and child health by 2015.
As a result, many governments and development agencies have been motivated to try new innovations and approaches that can boost health system functioning. RBF is one approach that is gaining momentum with country governments and development partners. RBF links financing to pre-determined results such as the actual use of health services, as well as their quality, and as opposed to financing inputs such as medical equipment or supplies. The experience so far shows promising results, especially in terms of increased utilization of key maternal and child health services. In addition, RBF is seen as a way to strengthen core health systems, making them more accountable and efficient by delivering greater value for money.
A vital aspect for any successful RBF approach is ensuring the appropriateness of the strategy for a particular context, which is at the core of this e-learning course. The World Bank Group and its partners has undertaken many capacity building engagements on RBF, including:
Consultations with key stakeholders.
Study tours from countries considering or starting RBF to those already implementing them.
Knowledge and lessons-sharing events.
Technical training workshops for policy makers and other stakeholders.
Peer-to-peer exchange forums.
These programs are geared at informed decision-making on the appropriateness of RBF and building implementation capacity to mitigate the risk of failure in implementing RBF mechanisms. This e-learning platform is designed to complement these initiatives, and to: equip  with the tools to decide whether RBF may be an appropriate policy option to consider in addressing health system challenges; and to be able to apply RBF design and implementation concepts/principles.
The objectives of the course are to:
Provide background knowledge on RBF and its different approaches.
Introduce core principles of RBF for health.
Provide some country examples of RBF for health in practice.

Consequently, many countries, especially those in Africa, risk not achieving the MDGs for maternal and child health by 2015., As a result, many governments and development agencies have been motivated to try new innovations and approaches that can boost health system functioning. RBF is one approach that is gaining momentum with country governments and development partners. RBF links financing to pre-determined results such as the actual use of health services, as well as their quality, and as opposed to financing inputs such as medical equipment or supplies. The experience so far shows promising results, especially in terms of increased utilization of key maternal and child health services. In addition, RBF is seen as a way to strengthen core health systems, making them more accountable and efficient by delivering greater value for money., A vital aspect for any successful RBF approach is ensuring the appropriateness of the strategy for a particular context, which is at the core of this e-learning course. The World Bank Group and its partners has undertaken many capacity building engagements on RBF, including:, These programs are geared at informed decision-making on the appropriateness of RBF and building implementation capacity to mitigate the risk of failure in implementing RBF mechanisms. This e-learning platform is designed to complement these initiatives, and to: equip  with the tools to decide whether RBF may be an appropriate policy option to consider in addressing health system challenges; and to be able to apply RBF design and implementation concepts/principles., The objectives of the course are to:,

Unfortunately, most of these deaths are now occurring in the developing world. The World Bank is moving to address this major public health challenge through its Environmental Health and Pollution Management business line with the launch of the Pollution Management and Environmental Health (PMEH) multi-donor trust fund, through pilot programs to demonstrate how to improve air quality in specific cities, through research to improve our understanding of where air pollution is most prevalent and through learning products such as this online e-learning course.

Benefits can include improved public health, energy savings, economic development, agricultural benefits, and reduced emissions of greenhouse gases and other short-lived climate pollution.

The SDGs are interconnected, recognizing that poverty cannot be eradicated without improved health and education, sustainable economic growth cannot occur on a planet under threat of climate change, and so forth., Goal 1,  End poverty in all its forms everywhere,  calls on stakeholders at every level to drastically reduce the number of people living in poverty, provide services and assistance to those in need, and ensure the resilience of the poor and vulnerable in times of crisis. SDG 1 builds on earlier calls to cut poverty in lower-income countries by, first, calling for the elimination of extreme poverty worldwide by 2030, and for every country to cut all dimensions of nationally-defined poverty by half by the same date. Goal 1 further draws linkages between poverty and climate disasters, and sets targets for social protection, resource mobilization and policy development. Likewise, Goal 10,  Reduce inequality within and among countries,  calls on stakeholders at all levels to empower the economic, political, and social inclusion of all people; and for governments to work together to provide pathways of opportunity across the world., This course will present an overview of the definitions, scale, and scope of different forms of poverty and inequality across the world.

    The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted by UN Member States in 2015 affirms that  the spread of information and communication technology and global interconnectedness has great potential to accelerate human progress, to bridge the digital divide and to develop knowledge societies.  Women s empowerment through E-Government can, indeed, accelerate the achievement of Goals and Targets across the 2030 Agenda. The new EGovforWomen Online Toolkit directly contributes to Sustainable Development Goals 5, 9, 10 and 16.

This online platform is an innovative public resource related to the design and implementation of gender-responsive E-government institutional ecosystems in the Asia-Pacific region. The toolkit represents the first region-wide toolbox to support the gender-mainstreaming of E-Government.  Through a set of 5 comprehensive modules, it provides key pointers for policymakers on gender-responsive design of e-service delivery, e-participation and connectivity initiatives, and introduces a capabilities-based approach to outcome evaluation of e-government for women s empowerment.

	Gender-responsive e-participation
	Gender-responsive connectivity architecture
	Assessing gender-responsiveness of e-government ecosystems
Each module is oriented towards a clearly identified target group, and is geared towards the attainment of specific learning outcomes. Therefore, all modules have clearly delineated sub-units to enable step-by-step learning and exercises/ assignments to test knowledge attainments (including a case study, food for thought, group assignments and quizzes). Content of the modules is drawn from the regional research on e-government for women s empowerment in Asia and the Pacific conducted by UNESCAP and IT for Change in 2015-16; as well as a scan of open source documentation of good practices in gender and e-government in the region, and in other contexts.

In the implementation of this project, ESCAP has partnered with IT for Change, India (www.ITforChange.net). IT for Change is a not-for-profit organisation that seeks to build a socially just and gender-equitable information society for the global South. Towards this, it is engaged in policy research, advocacy and field practice in the domains of gender, digital technologies and development; ICTs in education; e-government; Internet governance, digital rights; and data for development. At IT for Change, this project was led by Anita Gurumurthy, Executive Director with support from Nandini Chami, Senior Research Associate.

This project has been made possible with the generous funding from the Government of the Republic of Korea, through the Korea-ESCAP Cooperation Fund (KECF).
