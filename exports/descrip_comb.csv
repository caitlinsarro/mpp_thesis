"1","Planning for Climate Change in African Cities","Climate change poses a threat to economic growth and long-term prosperity of many countries around the world. Africa is not an exception, considering the actual and potential impacts of climate change and climate variability that will threaten its vulnerable sectors and human populations. African countries are projected to experience changing rainfall patterns, rising sea levels, and higher temperatures that will affect food security, agricultural production, water availability, and public health, among others. These climate change impacts and climate variability can further produce social and political problems, such as rural-urban migration and water resource disputes.   , Furthermore, the low levels of development in many African countries, as well as limited institutional, infrastructural, and technical capacities to respond successfully to climate change impacts and climate variability, can exacerbate the situation. In terms of contribution to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, although African countries are the lightest polluters, it has also become apparent that alternative energy sources can offset the increasing energy demand and dependence on biomass. Addressing climate change offers possibilities for low-carbon development. Moreover, there are promising mechanisms that can address both climate change actions and development goals simultaneously. 

At the city level, strengthening resilience, or the ability to respond to and absorb the effects of a hazardous event in a timely and efficient manner and to sustain this ability in the future, and adaptation; the process of adjusting to actual or expected climate change stimuli or their effects, should be at the forefront of planning.  Local governments have an important role to play through the provision of adequate infrastructure, regulation of land use, and other public services that are crucial for urban resilience. Mobilizing local governments, in collaboration with national governments, non-governmental organizations, and international organizations, among others, is also critical for an integrated multi-sectoral approach to climate change. 

The Course on Planning for Climate Change in African Cities provides the foundation for understanding cities<U+0092> exposure and sensitivity to climate change, and how cities can manage these impacts in the face of growing uncertainty. It does so by introducing the basic concepts of urban resilience and adaptation, by using illustrative case studies in different African cities. Furthermore, this module provides lectures on the different approaches for climate change planning, whether ad hoc, strategic or mainstreaming; introduces the different steps in the planning cycle <U+0096> from initial assessment to monitoring and evaluation; and presents the different decision support and assessment tools for prioritizing climate change actions. This course broadens the discussion on planning for climate change by engaging learners to apply their knowledge and practice their decision-making skills in a simulated exercise.

In line with development that minimizes the harm caused by climate change impacts, while maximizing the many human development opportunities presented by a more resilient future, we ask: what are the connections between urban risk and vulnerability? How is climate change and urban resilience conceptualized and applied in practice? Which policies and measures should be introduced to address climate change? Finally, how to choose among different measures that address climate change adaptation, urban resilience, and other development objectives?

"6","Climate Change and Water in Mountains: A Global Concern","What is climate change ? How are mountain regions affected by the evolution of water resources and their uses ? What kind of risks need to be considered ? , Mountains are recognized as particularly sensitive physical environments where intense and rapid changes have in the past, and may increasingly in the future, place pressure on their resource base. 

In this context, a team of roughly 100 experts worked from 2008 to 2013 for the European ACQWA project (www.acqwa.ch) which was coordinated by the University of Geneva. The primary objectives of the project were to assess the impacts of a changing climate on the quantity and quality of water originating in mountain regions, particularly where snow- and ice melt represent a large, sometimes the largest, streamflow component. A further objective of the project was to determine the potential disruptions to water-dependent economic activities related to the climate impacts on hydrological systems, and to propose a portfolio of possible adaptation strategies.

This particular MOOC is inspired by the ACQWA Project and offers a better understanding of climate change, its impacts on the quality and quantity of water in mountain regions and the risks related to changing water resources. From an interdisciplinary perspective, the participation of twenty-five instructors from five different countries (Switzerland, England, South Korea, India and Nepal) and fourteen institutions (UNIGE, RTS, UNIFR, UZH, ETHZ, Meteodat GmbH, WGMS, Imperial College London, Agroscope, R<e9>publique et Canton de Gen<e8>ve, Yonsei University, IHCAP, ICIMOD, SDC, FOEN) highlights the diversity of both theoretical and practical viewpoints related to these issues.

By the end of this course, you will be able :

- to define the general concept of climate change in mountain regions
- to understand the concepts associated with climate change such as adaptation and water governance strategies
- to consider the impacts of climate change on water resources in mountain regions
- to identify the impacts of climate change on hydropower, agriculture, aquatic ecosystems and health 
- to enumerate risks that can occur in mountain areas and lead to disruptions in water availability and use.

Your acquired knowledge will be evaluated through multiple-choice quizzes at the end of each unit of the course.

This MOOC on <U+0093>Climate Change and Water in Mountain Regions : A Global Concern<U+0094> was initiated and financed by the University of Geneva, through its Institute for Environmental Sciences.

"12","Climate Adaptation in Africa","This course explores why climate change adaptation is important in the African context. Africa is considered one to be one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change.   Historically, climate-related hazards such as drought, flooding, pest and disease outbreaks, coastal storms and heat waves have had devastating impacts on people and the environment in which they live. Often the damage knocks back progress that has been made in social and economic development, slowing down the achievement of development goals.  Climate models suggest that many of these climatic hazards will intensify as the global climate warms. Building resilience to climate risks, through adaptation, is critically important for future development in Africa., The course will examine adaptation in theory and in practice, through a focus on four sectors that are critically important for climate resilient development in Africa: Water Security, Agriculture and Food Security, Ecosystems and Ecosystem Services and Resilient Cities.","course explores climate change adaptation important african context africa considered one one vulnerable regions climate change historically climate related hazards drought flooding pest disease outbreaks coastal storms heat waves devastating impacts people environment live often damage knocks back progress made social economic development slowing achievement development goals climate models suggest many climatic hazards intensify global climate warms building resilience climate risks adaptation critically important future development africa course examine adaptation theory practice focus four sectors critically important climate resilient development africa water security agriculture food security ecosystems ecosystem services resilient cities","cours explor climat chang adapt import african context africa consid one one vulner region climat chang histor climat relat hazard drought flood pest diseas outbreak coastal storm heat wave devast impact peopl environ live often damag knock back progress made social econom develop slow achiev develop goal climat model suggest mani climat hazard intensifi global climat warm build resili climat risk adapt critic import futur develop africa cours examin adapt theori practic focus four sector critic import climat resili develop africa water secur agricultur food secur ecosystem ecosystem servic resili citi",12,0,2,0,5,"reflex_adpt_keystems"

As sustainability is a cross-disciplinary field of study, this foundation requires intellectual breadth: as I describe it in the class text, understanding our motivations requires the humanities, measuring the challenges of sustainability requires knowledge of the sciences (both natural and social), and building solutions requires technical insight into systems (such as provided by engineering, planning, and management).","course introduces academic approach sustainability explores today<U+393C><U+3E32>s human societies can endure face global change ecosystem degradation resource limitations course focuses key knowledge areas sustainability theory practice including population ecosystems global change energy agriculture water environmental economics policy ethics cultural history subject vital importance seeking uncover principles long term welfare peoples planet sustainability cross disciplinary field study foundation requires intellectual breadth describe class text understanding motivations requires humanities measuring challenges sustainability requires knowledge sciences natural social building solutions requires technical insight systems provided engineering planning management","cours introduc academ approach sustain explor today<U+393C><U+3E32> human societi can endur face global chang ecosystem degrad resourc limit cours focus key knowledg area sustain theori practic includ popul ecosystem global chang energi agricultur water environment econom polici ethic cultur histori subject vital import seek uncov principl long term welfar peopl planet sustain cross disciplinari field studi foundat requir intellectu breadth describ class text understand motiv requir human measur challeng sustain requir knowledg scienc natur social build solut requir technic insight system provid engin plan manag",15,1,2,2,2,"reflex_adpt_keystems"
"16","The Sustainable Development Goals <U+0096> A global, transdisciplinary vision for the future","In 2015, the UN launched the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Adopted by 193 member states, the goals represent an important international step in setting humanity on a trajectory towards sustainable development. Within this course, you will get a historical overview of how sustainability has been understood, as well as a thorough introduction to the SDGs <U+0096> what they are, how progress can be measured, and how the SDGs are relevant for the management of the global systems supporting humanity. The course will examine how various societal actors are responding to and implementing the SDGs. , While all of the SDGs are essential to sustainable development, SDG 13, Climate Action, is usually perceived as the most urgent in terms of the need for a swift implementation on a global scale. Therefore, particular focus is given to this SDG. Through the course, you will gain up-to-date knowledge of the current understanding of human impacts on the Earth at the planetary level. Progress towards establishing global management of human interactions with the climate system within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is also discussed.

The course is designed and taught by Professor Katherine Richardson, who is a member of the 15-person panel appointed by the UN General Secretary in 2016 to write the 2019 Global Sustainable Development Report. In each lecture, Katherine interviews experts who provide insights relevant to the topic at hand.","2015 un launched 17 sustainable development goals sdgs adopted 193 member states goals represent important international step setting humanity trajectory towards sustainable development within course get historical overview sustainability understood well thorough introduction sdgs <U+393C><U+3E36> progress can measured sdgs relevant management global systems supporting humanity course examine various societal actors responding implementing sdgs sdgs essential sustainable development sdg 13 climate action usually perceived urgent terms need swift implementation global scale therefore particular focus given sdg course gain date knowledge current understanding human impacts earth planetary level progress towards establishing global management human interactions climate system within united nations framework convention climate change unfccc also discussed course designed taught professor katherine richardson member 15 person panel appointed un general secretary 2016 write 2019 global sustainable development report lecture katherine interviews experts provide insights relevant topic hand","2015 un launch 17 sustain develop goal sdgs adopt 193 member state goal repres import intern step set human trajectori toward sustain develop within cours get histor overview sustain understood well thorough introduct sdgs <U+393C><U+3E36> progress can measur sdgs relev manag global system support human cours examin various societ actor respond implement sdgs sdgs essenti sustain develop sdg 13 climat action usual perceiv urgent term need swift implement global scale therefor particular focus given sdg cours gain date knowledg current understand human impact earth planetari level progress toward establish global manag human interact climat system within unit nation framework convent climat chang unfccc also discuss cours design taught professor katherin richardson member 15 person panel appoint un general secretari 2016 write 2019 global sustain develop report lectur katherin interview expert provid insight relev topic hand",16,5,4,2,7,"reflex_adpt_keystems"

This course, <U+0093>Beyond the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): Addressing Sustainability and Development,<U+0094> is the first course in the Sustainability and Development MasterTrack<U+00AE> Certificate, but you can also take this course as a stand-alone learning opportunity. , Sustainability and development pose unprecedented challenges as human societies grow and seek to ensure future wellbeing and prosperity. In this course, we<U+0092>ll focus on addressing the twin challenges of sustainability and development with actionable knowledge for innovating solutions to the world<U+0092>s most pressing problems like climate change, poverty and inequality, and biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation. Rather than sustainability being a qualifier for development (e.g. sustainable development), we conceptualize Sustainability and Development as co-equal fields of inquiry and action that seek to build bridges between the natural, social and applied sciences and the humanities. When sustainability and development are placed on an equal footing, it requires us to think more explicitly about the trade-offs, co-benefits and synergies between them, which we will be exploring in depth in each week.

Throughout the course, you will be introduced to the theoretical currents in Sustainability and Development, and will garner an in-depth understanding of the United Nations<U+0092> 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We will also consider the methods and skills necessary for designing innovative solutions to sustainability and development problems through the emerging field of Sustainability Science.

In this course, we will explore three of the most pressing challenges undergirding the  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) including climate change, poverty and inequality, and ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss, with case studies to guide and challenge our thinking. In the final week of the course, we will discuss the trade-offs, co-benefits and synergies between these challenges, especially as they relate to designing innovative solutions for achieving  our sustainability and development goals.

By the end of this course, you will be able to:
1. Understand and explain the world<U+0092>s most pressing problems with a specific focus on poverty & inequality, ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss, and climate change.
2. Critically analyze the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and their relationship to the world<U+0092>s most pressing problems.
3. Use frameworks and evidence necessary to develop solutions.
4. Assess relevant solutions that would help realize the SDGs and at the same time solve the pressing problems.

"25","Global Energy and Climate Policy","The Global Energy and Climate Policy course offers an introduction to the theoretical and practical understanding of how energy and climate change policies are designed, shaped, advocated and implemented. As energy markets go truly global, domestic energy policies are becoming more and more entangled with wider issues of international governance. Concurrently, the urgent need to mitigate and adapt to climate change and transition to a low-carbon future is adding a further layer of complexity. , The course is aimed broadly at people interested in learning more about interconnected issues in energy and climate policy globally. It assumes a level of interest but no necessary previous knowledge. However, the course also offers sufficient up to date research and new critical perspectives to be of interest to people with expertise in or academic familiarity with the topic as well. 

The main aim of the course is to provide this wide-ranging introduction in a self-contained, but in-depth form, alongside the important practical skills necessary to understand and discuss energy and climate policy, and lay the groundwork for greater engagement in the future <U+0096> either through academic study, in the public, private or not-for-profit sectors.","global energy climate policy course offers introduction theoretical practical understanding energy climate change policies designed shaped advocated implemented energy markets go truly global domestic energy policies becoming entangled wider issues international governance concurrently urgent need mitigate adapt climate change transition low carbon future adding layer complexity course aimed broadly people interested learning interconnected issues energy climate policy globally assumes level interest necessary previous knowledge however course also offers sufficient date research new critical perspectives interest people expertise academic familiarity topic well main aim course provide wide ranging introduction self contained depth form alongside important practical skills necessary understand discuss energy climate policy lay groundwork greater engagement future <U+393C><U+3E36> either academic study public private profit sectors","global energi climat polici cours offer introduct theoret practic understand energi climat chang polici design shape advoc implement energi market go truli global domest energi polici becom entangl wider issu intern govern concurr urgent need mitig adapt climat chang transit low carbon futur ad layer complex cours aim broad peopl interest learn interconnect issu energi climat polici global assum level interest necessari previous knowledg howev cours also offer suffici date research new critic perspect interest peopl expertis academ familiar topic well main aim cours provid wide rang introduct self contain depth form alongsid import practic skill necessari understand discuss energi climat polici lay groundwork greater engag futur <U+393C><U+3E36> either academ studi public privat profit sector",25,4,6,2,2,"policy_coh_keystems"

After the introductory lectures, we will examine the emerging field of sustainable energy, fuel and food production, emphasizing the importance of developing energy efficient and sustainable methods of production, and how these new technologies can contribute to replacing the diminishing supplies of fossil fuels, and reduce the consequences of carbon dioxide release into the environment. This course will also cover the importance of creating a sustainable energy future for all societies including those of the developing world.  Lectures will be prepared and delivered by leading UC San Diego and Scripps Institution of Oceanography faculty and industry professionals across these areas of expertise.","course designed introduce students issues energy 21st century <U+393C><U+3E36> including food fuels <U+393C><U+3E36> inseparably linked <U+393C><U+3E36> discuss energy production utilization biology engineering economics climate science social science perspectives course cover current production utilization energy well consequences use examining finite fossil energy reserves food energy linked impacts environment climate social economic impacts present energy food production use introductory lectures examine emerging field sustainable energy fuel food production emphasizing importance developing energy efficient sustainable methods production new technologies can contribute replacing diminishing supplies fossil fuels reduce consequences carbon dioxide release environment course also cover importance creating sustainable energy future societies including developing world lectures prepared delivered leading uc san diego scripps institution oceanography faculty industry professionals across areas expertise","cours design introduc student issu energi 21st centuri <U+393C><U+3E36> includ food fuel <U+393C><U+3E36> insepar link <U+393C><U+3E36> discuss energi product util biolog engin econom climat scienc social scienc perspect cours cover current product util energi well consequ use examin finit fossil energi reserv food energi link impact environ climat social econom impact present energi food product use introductori lectur examin emerg field sustain energi fuel food product emphas import develop energi effici sustain method product new technolog can contribut replac diminish suppli fossil fuel reduc consequ carbon dioxid releas environ cours also cover import creat sustain energi futur societi includ develop world lectur prepar deliv lead uc san diego scripp institut oceanographi faculti industri profession across area expertis",26,3,3,4,2,"democratic_keystems"

This MOOC is at the junction between the development of Southern countries and sustainable development. 
It has: 
1) a macroeconomic and financial dimension, developed by Gael Giraud and Alain Grandjean; 
2) an ecological and climatic dimension, developed by David Claessen and ENS speakers; and 
3) a focus on Southern countries, developed by AFD speakers.

Here are the learning goals for the entire training program:

Goal 1: Be able to understand the relationship between the energy transition, the ecological transition, the role of energy in our economy, our economic development model, and financing issues. 
Goal 2: Know how to advocate for and lobby on issues and on the need to change reality in order to implement strategies and action plans.
Goal 3: Be able to make a link between the Energy transition and financing solutions, and between comprehension and action.  
No one questions the imperative need to ensure development based on personal well-being and a fair distribution of wealth.

The Challenges of a Transition for All  
Until now the development of Northern countries has been based on an increasing exploitation of energy resources and a greater freedom of trade and exchange at the global scale. We now know that such a model is no longer sustainable, due to global warming and to the overexploitation of resources, which lead to health, social, and environmental disasters.

The Role of Developing Countries
With that in mind, how can we ensure fair and equitable growth for all? What role do countries from the different regions in the South have to play in this complete upheaval of the current economic, trade, and political models in order to achieve an effective energy and ecological transition?
  
A MOOC to Respond to these Questions
This free online training offers complementary perspectives from several specialists of issues related to climate change and the development of Southern countries. They will share their very practical understanding of the current crises and the answers that can be provided. Participants will learn from studies by:
<U+0095> Researchers from the prestigious <c9>cole Normale Sup<e9>rieure in Paris
<U+0095> Field experts from the Agence Fran<e7>aise de D<e9>veloppement, a funding agency that has been committed to helping developing countries for 75 years,

"28","Anti-Corruption in the context of the 2030 Agenda","The 2030 Agenda was a major breakthrough for the anti-corruption movement, as it emphasizes the importance of promoting transparency, accountability and anti-corruption for sustainable development, and makes an explicit link between corruption, peace and just and inclusive societies.
UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner said, <U+0093>the 2030 Agenda has established anti-corruption as a global imperative on which hinges the achievement of all sustainable development goals. Goal 16 is rooted in human rights and highlights the importance of strengthening institutions and governance in our pledge to leave no one behind. We also have the opportunity to advance the anti-corruption agenda through the implementation of the UN Convention Against Corruption, which has now reached near-universal ratification, providing a comprehensive global framework to fight corruption in alignment with the 2030 Agenda. Corruption is a complex challenge that continues to persist in many countries across the world. It has a direct impact on the three dimensions of sustainable development <U+0096> social, economic and environmental <U+0096> and affects each of the five pillars of the 2030 agenda: people, planet, prosperity, peace and partnerships.<U+0094>
Despite progress made, corruption is still a pressing challenge. Resources lost through corruption exceed the estimated 10 trillion dollars required to eradicate poverty by 2030. Money lost to corruption is essentially development denied to those most at risk of being left behind.

By providing an internationally agreed standard with agreed concepts, definitions and classifications, the SEEA is an invaluable tool for compiling integrated statistics on the economy and the environment. The SEEA framework follows a similar accounting structure to the System of National Accounts (SNA). The SEEA uses concepts, definitions and classifications consistent with the SNA in order to facilitate the integration of environmental and economic statistics. By doing so, the SEEA allows us to develop indicators and conduct analysis on the economy-environment nexus.
The SEEA facilitates better informed decision-making. The SEEA Central Framework offers a means of monitoring pressures exerted by the economy on the environment, in terms of abstraction of natural resources and emissions; impacts in terms of changes in stocks of natural resources; and how the economy responds in terms of expenditure on environmental protection and resource management. The SEEA does not propose particular indicators, but is instead a holistic multi-purpose information system that can generate a wide range of statistics and indicators with varying potential analytical applications.
The course is self-paced without instruction and can be taken at any point in time.
The course is available in Arabic, English, French, Russian and Spanish.

									, The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Goals (SDGs) call for collaboration and partnership like never before. Achieving the SDGs requires us to look at complex global challenges through many different dimensions. The SDG Lab was created to do just that <U+0097> by acting as a connector, amplifier, question asker and innovator. This toolkit is a living document that captures the Lab<U+0092>s journey by providing insight into the methods, tools and techniques that, if used, can enable you or your organization to deliver on the Agenda. The toolkit can be used as the foundation for your own lab or to inspire new ways of working, it can help you in:,

"36","Integration of the SDGs into National Planning","The e-learning course on the Integration of the SDGs into National Planning was developed by UN ESCAP to support policy makers and sustainable development practitioners in development of strategies and plans to implement the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development and the SDGs.
The complex and aspirational 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), require multidisciplinary methods for developing implementation strategies because of their <U+0093>indivisible whole<U+0094> nature. Furthermore, the 17 Sustainable Development Goals and their targets are closely interlinked and require innovative and unconventional policy approaches, such as those focusing on the intersections (meeting points), interlinkages and complex causal relationships. This e-Learning course deals with the aspects of <U+0092>Why<U+0092> and <U+0091>How<U+0092> of integration and ESCAP methodologies and tools to aid integrated and interlinked policy making process.
The course consists of three modules, which give insights on the importance of the integration of the three dimensions of sustainable development, and provide further guidance on available tools and their application for policy making and implementation.
The first module on Integration of the Three Dimensions of Sustainable Development is based on the UN ESCAP publication with correlating title <U+0096> Integrating the three dimensions of sustainable development: A framework and tools. The module defines and articulates to policy makers the essence of integration of the three dimensions of sustainable developmentnamely economic, social and environmental, across the policy cycle.
The second module on Systems Thinking Framework to Support the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development and the SDGs provides an overview of systems thinking methodology and school of thought, a step-by-step guide to systems thinking modelling and examples of application in countries of the Asia-Pacific region. The module also briefly introduces the ESCAP experience in applying systems thinking to SDG integration analysis and provides examples and case studies from contributing partners.
The third module on ESCAP<U+0092>s Methodology for Applying Systems Thinking in Asia-Pacific Countries for Integrating SDG 6 into National Planning describes the practical application of the ESCAP analytical framework for integration of SDG 6 on Clean Water and Sanitation with the other 16 SDGs at the target level and builds on the Analytical Framework for Integration of Water and Sanitation SDGs and Targets Using Systems Thinking Approach. The module also describes the practical application of the methodology in pilot countries and lessons learned.

"38","SEEA: In Depth Training on Energy Accounting","The System for Environmental-Economic Accounting-Energy (SEEA-Energy) is a multi-purpose conceptual framework for organizing energy-related statistics. It supports analysis of the role of energy within the economy, the state of energy inputs and various energy-related transactions of environmental interest. It is fully consistent with the SEEA Central Framework. Energy information is typically presented in physical terms, but the SEEA-Energy also applies monetary valuations to various stocks and flows, based on the SEEA accounting approach.The SEEA-Energy is consistent with the SEEA Central Framework and follows a similar accounting structure to the System of National Accounts (SNA). The SEEA-Energy uses concepts, definitions and classifications consistent with the SNA in order to facilitate the integration of energy and economic statistics. By doing so, the SEEA-Energy allows us to develop indicators and conduct analysis on the economy-environment nexus, with a focus on energy.
The SEEA-Energy facilitates better informed decision-making, particularly for energy policy, climate policy and natural resource management. The SEEA-Energy offers a means of monitoring pressures exerted by the economy on the environment, in terms of extraction of energy from the environment; impacts in terms of changes in stocks of energy resources and air emissions; and how the economy responds in terms of expenditure on environmental protection and resource management. The SEEA-Energy does not propose particular indicators, but is instead a holistic multi-purpose information system that can generate a wide range of statistics and indicators with varying potential analytical applications. For example, Goal 7 of the SDGs focuses specifically on energy, and the SEEA-Energy methdology can play an important role in measuring these targets by providing a framework for the development of indicators.
The course is self-paced without instruction and can be taken at any point in time. It is available in English, Russian and Arabic

The SEEA EEA complements the SEEA Central Framework by taking a different perspective. The Central Framework looks at <U+0093>individual environmental assets<U+0094>, such as water resources, energy resources, etc. and how those assets move between the environment and the economy. In contrast, the SEEA EEA takes the perspective of ecosystems and considers how individual environmental assets interact as part of natural processes within a given spatial area. Ecosystem accounting takes a spatial approach, often utilizing earth observation and geospatial data. Using this spatial approach, the SEEA EEA accounts for the extent and condition of ecosystems, the flow of services provided by ecosystems and the contributions and benefits of ecosystems to economic and other human activity.
This course provides an overview of the SEEA EEA, including how the SEEA EEA can be used for policy. The course covers ecosystem extent, condition and service accounts as well as accounting for biodiversity, water and carbon.
The course is self-paced without instruction and can be taken at any point in time.
The course is available in English and Spanish.

The course aims at supporting UN leaders to articulate, facilitate and broker the needed changes in support of the people in the countries they serve.

The UN needs visionary and principled leadership across the system to address today<U+0092>s challenging world. It needs leaders who stand up for UN values<U+0097> and who inspire through their commitment to peace, justice, respect, human rights, tolerance, and solidarity.
Participants will deepen their knowledge and sharpen their political acumen through engaging discussions with UN senior officials and subject matter experts. There will be opportunities to share practices through interactive peer-to-peer learning and workshops that<U+00A0>unpack inter-agency concerns as well as individual agency contexts and develop solutions that leverage each UN agency<U+0092>s strengths and expertise.

The purpose of this course is to share the latest knowledge and approaches to measuring and managing plastic pollution from land-based sources, in particular cities, for the achievement of local, national and regional goals related to sustainable development.
ABSTRACT
Plastic pollution is entering our oceans at an alarming rate, damaging our marine environments and endangering local livelihoods. The Asia-Pacific is an important centre of innovation for plastic waste management and a hotspot for pollution. Across the region, cities and city governments are at the frontier of global efforts to stop plastic waste entering the environment. 
This course was developed for the Closing the Loop project by UN ESCAP in partnership with the Government of Japan. Closing the Loop aims to reduce the environmental impact of cities in ASEAN by addressing plastic waste pollution in the marine environment. In support of the ASEAN Framework of Action on Marine Debris and the G20 Osaka Blue Ocean Vision, the project will bring a more circular approach to plastic waste management and reduce the amount of waste entering the marine environment.
This course was developed to facilitate local government capacity building on the topic of marine plastic waste. Course development was led by UN ESCAP in collaboration with Ocean Conservancy, UN Environment Programme (UNEP), the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES), Women in Informal Employment: Globalizing and Organizing (WIEGO), Coordinating Body on the Seas of East Asia (COBSEA), Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), the International Solid Waste Association (ISWA), Plymouth Marine Lab, Wageningen University & Research, Keio University and the University of Leeds.

"56","Social Protection for Sustainable Development","Introduction
This course explores social protection as it applies to sustainable development, the 2030 Agenda, and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
Social protection is a key element of national strategies to promote human development, political stability, and inclusive growth. Currently, an estimated 53 per cent of the world<U+0092>s population lives without any form of social protection.
Social protection is more relevant than ever to address social and economic impact during and after the unfolding health emergency.<U+00A0>The pandemic has illuminated both the gaps and advantages of access to national health care systems and the implementation of policies to support income security.
The ambitious objectives set out in the 2030 Agenda and the unprecedented social protection requirements related to COVID-19 will involve concerted efforts from across the spectrum of UN and national actors, linking interventions and leveraging new tools to build universal social protection programmes and achieve the 2030 Agenda promise of life in dignity and prosperity on a healthy planet.
This course will prepare participants to do just that, by focusing on the <U+0093>what<U+0094>, <U+0093>why<U+0094>, and <U+0093>how<U+0094> of social protection principles in order to prepare them to work among social protection experts, advocates, and beneficiaries.

"57","Integrating Climate Risk Information into NAPs","At its 21st session, the UNFCCC Conference of Parties (COP-21) emphasized the importance of accelerated adaptation planning and implementation. As of August 2017, 152 Parties to the Convention out of 197 have submitted their first Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to the UNFCCC, with 102 including an adaptation component, the majority being developing countries. The UNFCCC report released in October 2016 on progress in the process of formulating and implementing National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) indicates that many more countries, including over 80% of Least Developed Countries (LDCs), have embarked on developing a NAP.
The development and implementation of NAPs involve decisions related to climate risk management, which require reliable, relevant, usable and timely climate information.
Climate information used within the NAP process encompasses a wide range of information on past, present and future climate, and products which help improve the understanding of climate and its impacts on natural and human systems and support decisions to improve climate-related outcomes. Climate services involve the production, translation, transfer and use of climate knowledge and information for this purpose. Climate services, therefore, play a crucial role in the planning, financing and implementation of adaptation to climate change.
In this context and drawing on the WMO-led Global Framework for Climate Services (GFCS), WMO and UNITAR developed capacity building e-learning materials in support of a wider training package on <U+0093>Integration Climate Risk Information into National Adaptation Planning<U+0094>. The aim of this e-learning component is to contribute to capacity building that will bridge the information and communication gaps currently affecting the demand for climate information services and their supply.

The course is designed to respond the learning needs of both climate services providers (National Hydro-meteorological Services, research/academic and international organizations), and users (e.g. decision makers, private investors, non-governmental organizations, etc.), as well as of those working at the science-policy interface for outreach or communication purposes.
The training is modular<U+00A0> and provides you with the liberty to<U+00A0> choose and combine different thematic modules. There are two main themes or learning tracks available as illustrated in the figure below.
Learning track 1 (green-colored): Producing climate information for NAPs
Learning track 2 (yellow-colored):<U+00A0>Using climate information for NAPs
Both learning tracks have in common the Intro and Wrap-up modules.
How to choose the learning track that best suits your profile and learning needs?
Once you complete the Intro module, you are recommended to undertake a test. Based on your answers to the five questions of the test you will be advised to follow either learning track 1 or 2, or both.
Each learning track culminates with a quiz that will assess the knowledge you will acquire. If you pass the quiz with a minimum mark of 70%, a certificate of completion will be issued to you. If you choose to follow both learning tracks you can receive two certificates by passing both quizzes.

"59","Financing in Health","Results Based Financing (RBF) for Health is an interactive course that includes narrated presentations, discussion forums, group work and a quiz for each module to assess your knowledge.
The course is based on materials developed over the course of several years for the delivery of face-to-face RBF learning events, which generated a rich repository of knowledge. That knowledge has been translated into e-learning modules to reach a critical mass of health practitioners globally. The course aims to equip participants with specific knowledge to help determine whether RBF is an appropriate tool for their context and if so, what type of RBF approach may be appropriate to adopt.
The e-learning course is supported by funding from the Health Results Innovation Trust Fund (HRITF). Since 2007, HRITF has been pioneering RBF programs, with a particular focus on improving maternal and child health outcomes to accelerate progress towards Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 1c, 4 and 5. Learn more:<U+00A0>www.rbfhealth.org<U+00A0>or<U+00A0>www.facebook.com/RBFhealth<U+00A0>and<U+00A0>www.twitter.com/RBFhealth.
Please take a moment to listen to the course introduction by Petra Vergeer, who is one of the main coordinators of this e-learning course and who helped develop and taught the material in this course in its face-to-face version.
Course context
Traditionally, government and donor funds to improve health service delivery have concentrated on increasing critical inputs, such as infrastructure, equipment, supplies, drugs and vaccines. Since the adoption of the Millennium Declaration in 2000, this development assistance for health has more than doubled. And yet the increase in investments has not translated into the expected health outcomes in low and middle income countries. The challenge these countries face is unequal access and utilization of essential health services, often due to low quality of services, inefficient delivery of services and limited management capacity. In addition, poor households in many countries face impoverishment due to limited financial protection in the health system. Consequently, many countries, especially those in Africa, risk not achieving the MDGs for maternal and child health by 2015.
As a result, many governments and development agencies have been motivated to try new innovations and approaches that can boost health system functioning. RBF is one approach that is gaining momentum with country governments and development partners. RBF links financing to pre-determined results such as the actual use of health services, as well as their quality, and as opposed to financing inputs such as medical equipment or supplies. The experience so far shows promising results, especially in terms of increased utilization of key maternal and child health services. In addition, RBF is seen as a way to strengthen core health systems, making them more accountable and efficient by delivering greater value for money.
A vital aspect for any successful RBF approach is ensuring the appropriateness of the strategy for a particular context, which is at the core of this e-learning course. The World Bank Group and its partners has undertaken many capacity building engagements on RBF, including:
Consultations with key stakeholders.
Study tours from countries considering or starting RBF to those already implementing them.
Knowledge and lessons-sharing events.
Technical training workshops for policy makers and other stakeholders.
Peer-to-peer exchange forums.
These programs are geared at informed decision-making on the appropriateness of RBF and building implementation capacity to mitigate the risk of failure in implementing RBF mechanisms. This e-learning platform is designed to complement these initiatives, and to: equip participants with the tools to decide whether RBF may be an appropriate policy option to consider in addressing health system challenges; and to be able to apply RBF design and implementation concepts/principles.
The objectives of the course are to:
Provide background knowledge on RBF and its different approaches.
Introduce core principles of RBF for health.
Provide some country examples of RBF for health in practice.

"68","ILO Labour Market Statistics and Analysis Academy","The course begins with an overview of the scope of labour market statistics and the key sources of data which are typically used for this purpose, including some strengths and weaknesses of key sources.
This is followed by an overview of the key conceptual framework which is the source of internationally adopted definitions of employment, unemployment, work and related topics.
A key focus is placed on labour force survey, with the provision of an overview of key areas of methodology including questionnaire design, sampling, application of classifications and dissemination among other stages of the statistical process.
Some additional key topics such as gender mainstreaming in labour statistics, earnings and informality are also covered.
A feature of the academy design is a multi-track design which provides the same content on certain aspects for all participants in plenary, while for limited parts of the academy different choices are made available reflecting the participants preference to focus on analysis or survey planning or other options at different points in the programme.
The resource persons providing the training are professional statistical staff of the International Labour Organisation with additional external experts for some components where appropriate.
The academy is hosted at the ILO ITC training centre in Turin on an annual basis in the last quarter of the year in English. The duration of the academy is 2 weeks. The academy has also been hosted in other locations (for example Cote d<U+0092>Ivoire) and delivered in French.
In future instances it is intended to host the academy in additional locations and the three ILO official languages (English, French and Spanish) subject to available resources and demands.

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is unprecedented in its scope and ambition. The UN and governments have neither the reach nor the resources to implement it alone. Engagement, especially with the private sector, is imperative for the 2030 Agenda to succeed.
The private sector with its unparalleled reach has the capacity to be a key driver to achieve the objectives of the 2030 Agenda and in some cases is already performing this role. The UN and its member states must seize the opportunity to form strategic partnerships with private sector entities and advocate for businesses to embrace sustainable development in order to achieve the 2030 Agenda.
Moreover, the 2030 Agenda offers the private sector numerous opportunities to access new markets and institutional investment, estimated at about $12 trillion by 2030 while adding 380 million new jobs. This in itself is a compelling argument for the private sector and governments to work together to make the 2030 Agenda a reality.

"75","Measuring Productivity","Productivity is one of the major determinants of the standard of living, since increases in productivity may result in higher real income and promote price stability. The measurement of productivity is an important element in the evaluation of the relative efficiency of factor utilization domestically and internationally. The analysis of trends in productivity, especially labor productivity, is a factor in the successful examination of occupational mobility, the projection of future employment opportunities, and the determination of future workforce and training policies.
The seminar includes discussions on the following topics:
Definitions and concepts
Output, inputs, prices and costs, index theory, and aggregation methods
Methodology for calculating output per hour and multifactor productivity measures
Output measurement including deflated value and physical quantity measures, input measurement, aggregation of heterogeneous outputs and inputs, index construction, and index linking
Sources of data
Various government and private sources (including discussion of poor or fragmentary data) for derivation of: output measures, input measures (including labor, capital, and intermediate purchases), and weights
Trend analysis
Changes in productivity, factor input shifts, and historical analysis
Data used to construct productivity measures are also used to report on the following SDG indicators:
Indicator 8.2.1: Annual growth rate of real GDP per employed person
Indicator 9.2.2: Manufacturing employment as a proportion of total employment

Unfortunately, most of these deaths are now occurring in the developing world. The World Bank is moving to address this major public health challenge through its Environmental Health and Pollution Management business line with the launch of the<U+00A0>Pollution Management and Environmental Health<U+00A0>(PMEH)<U+00A0>multi-donor trust fund, through pilot programs to demonstrate how to improve air quality in specific cities, through research to improve our understanding of where air pollution is most prevalent and through learning products such as this online e-learning course.
This<U+00A0>Air Quality Management series of courses has been created for development professionals, government officials, and other partners who want to learn about the fundamentals of air quality management planning. Successful air quality management programs can reduce emissions that lead to air pollution while simultaneously providing other development benefits that accrue locally as well as globally. Benefits can include improved public health, energy savings, economic development, agricultural benefits, and reduced emissions of greenhouse gases and other short-lived climate pollution. We hope this introductory course provides the foundation for establishing such a program in your community and that follow-up courses will provide skills and information on how to monitor air pollution and increase public awareness, how to develop emission inventories and track progress, how to assess the benefits of air quality improvement, how to select control strategies that are most effective and finally these courses will share information on the importance of stakeholder engagement and describe regulatory approaches that have been most effective elsewhere.
Designing and implementing an effective Air Quality Management (AQM) program relies on a complete understanding of the specific issues affecting a given region, requiring awareness raising, data collection and capacity building. This course provides a basic introduction to concepts of air pollution and its management.

What assets do people need?
How can these assets be made to last the longest and perform the best?
How can their potential to save or generate revenue be maximized so as to unlock financial resources for other community needs, now and in the future?
In the answers to these questions lies the key to ensuring the reliability of public infrastructure and services at all levels.
This e-learning course aims to equip policymakers and government officials to find the answers in their specific national and local contexts.<U+00A0> It makes a compelling case that ultimately, asset management is a way to align strategic planning with infrastructure and service delivery in the real world. It will equip the learner with a rich set of tools to promote sound, forward-looking asset management that enhances the resilience, sustainability, reliability, and financial viability of infrastructure investments for present and future generations.
The course is divided into two parts: Fundamentals: Infrastructure Asset Management for Sustainable Development (Module 1-4) and InFocus: Infrastructure Asset Management for Sustainable Development (Module 5-8).

How can transboundary water cooperation play a role in leading to peace?, is pivotal for , FRESHWATER SECURITY, as a, TOP PRIORITY, in , TRANSBOUNDARY WATER MANAGEMENT, to address , WATER SECURITY CHALLENGES, Freshwater scarcity, stress, and crisis are increasing worldwide. More than a billion people live in water-scarce regions, and 3.5 billion could experience water scarcity by 2025. These pressures disproportionally affect vulnerable and marginalized people, including those living in poverty and displacement. Rising pollution levels accelerate the crisis by reducing water availability for human use and impacting aquatic life in rivers, lakes, aquifers, and the oceans., Transboundary basins account for roughly 60% of freshwater resources, serving 2.8 billion people, or 42% of the world<U+0092>s population. Complex shared transboundary freshwater and ecosystems cut across myriad sectoral needs, themes, and political boundaries. Setting effective policy goals, coupled with investments, means working at multiple scales with a range of public and private stakeholders throughout the watershed, from source to sea and beyond., This course presents multiple facets of governance for transboundary freshwater security <U+0096> from financing mechanisms to negotiation skills <U+0096> while emphasizing the urgency of sustainable development and cooperation at many levels. It extends from basic building blocks and concepts to advanced thinking about transboundary governance, and applies theory to practice through examples and case studies. Topics covered in six modules range from the fundamentals of transboundary water security to international water law, water diplomacy, negotiations, institutions, management tools, and sustainable finance., The course is designed for professionals who manage and make decisions about transboundary waters within line ministries and river basin organizations; managers of transboundary water projects and the Global Environment Facility (GEF) International Waters Portfolio; the GEF IW:LEARN Network; NGOs, academics, and private sector actors working on basin management; development practitioners; young professionals and future leaders in transboundary waters, including undergraduate and graduate students; and anyone else who is keen to learn about the topic., This MOOC was produced by the Global Water Partnership in collaboration with GEF IW:LEARN and its partners. Over 80 water professionals from around the world brought their experiences to lectures and case studies. Modules are coordinated by United Nations University, Northumbria University, Stockholm International Water Institute, IHE-Delft, United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, and the Global Water Partnership.,  Module 1: Introduction to the MOOC and Freshwater Security,  Module 2: Water Diplomacy and Negotiation Skills,  Module 3: International Water Law,  Module 4: Institutions,  Module 5:

The SDGs are interconnected, recognizing that poverty cannot be eradicated without improved health and education, sustainable economic growth cannot occur on a planet under threat of climate change, and so forth., Goal 1, <U+0093>End poverty in all its forms everywhere,<U+0094> calls on stakeholders at every level to drastically reduce the number of people living in poverty, provide services and assistance to those in need, and ensure the resilience of the poor and vulnerable in times of crisis. SDG 1 builds on earlier calls to cut poverty in lower-income countries by, first, calling for the elimination of extreme poverty worldwide by 2030, and for every country to cut all dimensions of nationally-defined poverty by half by the same date. Goal 1 further draws linkages between poverty and climate disasters, and sets targets for social protection, resource mobilization and policy development. Likewise, Goal 10, <U+0093>Reduce inequality within and among countries,<U+0094> calls on stakeholders at all levels to empower the economic, political, and social inclusion of all people; and for governments to work together to provide pathways of opportunity across the world., This course will present an overview of the definitions, scale, and scope of different forms of poverty and inequality across the world. It will examine links between poverty, inequality, and well-being; opportunities for socioeconomic mobility; the particular challenges facing women, minorities, Indigenous people, and vulnerable populations; and how poverty and inequality link to issues like climate change, migration, and conflict. Finally, the course will conclude with a look at policy approaches and tools for addressing poverty and inequality in a variety of contexts.,   Understanding Poverty and Inequality was created by the SDG Academy in partnership with the Center for Sustainable Development at the Brookings Institution.,  Module 1: An Introduction to Poverty and Inequality,  Module 2: Multidimensional Measures of Poverty,  Module 3: Explaining Global Inequality,  Module 4:Poverty and Subjective Well-being,  Module 5: Identity and Exclusion,  Module 6: Poverty and Inequality, Today and Tomorrow","mean <U+393C><U+3E33>poverty<U+393C><U+3E34> <U+393C><U+3E33>inequality<U+393C><U+3E34> take achieve sdg 1 poverty sdg 10 reduced inequalities 2030 mean <U+393C><U+3E33>poverty<U+393C><U+3E34> <U+393C><U+3E33>inequality<U+393C><U+3E34> take achieve sdg 1 poverty sdg 10 reduced inequalities 2030 causes poverty inequality remaining challenges poverty reduction around world help ensure one left behind september 2015 193 member states united nations adopted 2030 agenda sustainable development committed 17 sustainable development goals sdgs sdgs interconnected recognizing poverty eradicated without improved health education sustainable economic growth occur planet threat climate change forth goal 1 <U+393C><U+3E33>end poverty forms everywhere <U+393C><U+3E34> calls stakeholders every level drastically reduce number people living poverty provide services assistance need ensure resilience poor vulnerable times crisis sdg 1 builds earlier calls cut poverty lower income countries first calling elimination extreme poverty worldwide 2030 every country cut dimensions nationally defined poverty half date goal 1 draws linkages poverty climate disasters sets targets social protection resource mobilization policy development likewise goal 10 <U+393C><U+3E33>reduce inequality within among countries <U+393C><U+3E34> calls stakeholders levels empower economic political social inclusion people governments work together provide pathways opportunity across world course present overview definitions scale scope different forms poverty inequality across world examine links poverty inequality well opportunities socioeconomic mobility particular challenges facing women minorities indigenous people vulnerable populations poverty inequality link issues like climate change migration conflict finally course conclude look policy approaches tools addressing poverty inequality variety contexts understanding poverty inequality created sdg academy partnership center sustainable development brookings institution module 1 introduction poverty inequality module 2 multidimensional measures poverty module 3 explaining global inequality module 4 poverty subjective well module 5 identity exclusion module 6 poverty inequality today tomorrow","mean <U+393C><U+3E33>poverty<U+393C><U+3E34> <U+393C><U+3E33>inequality<U+393C><U+3E34> take achiev sdg 1 poverti sdg 10 reduc inequ 2030 mean <U+393C><U+3E33>poverty<U+393C><U+3E34> <U+393C><U+3E33>inequality<U+393C><U+3E34> take achiev sdg 1 poverti sdg 10 reduc inequ 2030 caus poverti inequ remain challeng poverti reduct around world help ensur one left behind septemb 2015 193 member state unit nation adopt 2030 agenda sustain develop commit 17 sustain develop goal sdgs sdgs interconnect recogn poverti erad without improv health educ sustain econom growth occur planet threat climat chang forth goal 1 <U+393C><U+3E33>end poverti form everywher <U+393C><U+3E34> call stakehold everi level drastic reduc number peopl live poverti provid servic assist need ensur resili poor vulner time crisi sdg 1 build earlier call cut poverti lower incom countri first call elimin extrem poverti worldwid 2030 everi countri cut dimens nation defin poverti half date goal 1 draw linkag poverti climat disast set target social protect resourc mobil polici develop likewis goal 10 <U+393C><U+3E33>reduc inequ within among countri <U+393C><U+3E34> call stakehold level empow econom polit social inclus peopl govern work togeth provid pathway opportun across world cours present overview definit scale scope differ form poverti inequ across world examin link poverti inequ well opportun socioeconom mobil particular challeng face women minor indigen peopl vulner popul poverti inequ link issu like climat chang migrat conflict final cours conclud look polici approach tool address poverti inequ varieti context understand poverti inequ creat sdg academi partnership center sustain develop brook institut modul 1 introduct poverti inequ modul 2 multidimension measur poverti modul 3 explain global inequ modul 4 poverti subject well modul 5 ident exclus modul 6 poverti inequ today tomorrow",93,12,11,9,1,"participation_keystems"

How will automation affect the future of work?, What does it take to achieve SDG 8 and realize decent work for all? What is the link between employment, work, income and wealth? How will automation affect the future of work?, Examine work and employment's, STRUCTURAL SHIFTS, Trace the rise of a modern, WELFARE STATE, How will AI reshape the, WORLD OF WORK?, What does it take to, ACHIEVE SDG 8?, National economies have grown substantially since the Industrial Revolution of the 19th century, yet people have not necessarily seen an increase in opportunities to find decent work or earn a decent income. In fact, in some places, the increased productivity and rising profits associated with automation have directly impacted the availability of decent jobs. According to the International Labour Organization, more than 204 million people were unemployed in 2015, and more than 600 million new jobs are needed by 2030 just to keep pace with the growth of the working-age population. We also need to improve working conditions for the 780 million women and men who are employed but not earning enough to lift themselves and their families out of poverty. In addressing these core issues we will not only see increasing decent work opportunities but also more robust, inclusive and poverty-reducing growth., This course explores the past and future of work in the context of the SDGs, particularly SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth. It examines the state of income and employment around the world, barriers to employment, policies to promote economic opportunity, and the future of work in our rapidly changing world. Encouraging entrepreneurship and job creation are key to achieving the SDGs, as are effective measures to eradicate forced labor, slavery, and human trafficking. With these targets in mind, the world can achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men by 2030., This seven-module massive open online course (MOOC) provides an in-depth look at the issues of inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all. The topics covered include structural shifts in economies and work; informality, gender, and child labor; the modern welfare state; the future of work; and more. The course concludes with a special module by the ILO on realizing decent work for all and achieving SDG 8., You will learn about:,  Module 1: Decent Work for Sustainable Development,  Module 2: Transitions in Employment and Work,  Module 3: Challenges of Work: Informality, Gender and Child Labor,  Module 4: Current Policy Responses,  Module 5: Structural and Institutional Models for the Future of Work,  Module 6: Future of Jobs and Work,  Module 7: Special Module in Partnership with the ILO: Achieving SDG 8 and Realizing Decent Work for All","take achieve sdg 8 realize decent work link employment work income wealth automation affect future work take achieve sdg 8 realize decent work link employment work income wealth automation affect future work examine work employment s structural shifts trace rise modern welfare state ai reshape world work take achieve sdg 8 national economies grown substantially since industrial revolution 19th century yet people necessarily seen increase opportunities find decent work earn decent income fact places increased productivity rising profits associated automation directly impacted availability decent jobs according international labour organization 204 million people unemployed 2015 600 million new jobs needed 2030 just keep pace growth working age population also need improve working conditions 780 million women men employed earning enough lift families poverty addressing core issues see increasing decent work opportunities also robust inclusive poverty reducing growth course explores past future work context sdgs particularly sdg 8 decent work economic growth examines state income employment around world barriers employment policies promote economic opportunity future work rapidly changing world encouraging entrepreneurship job creation key achieving sdgs effective measures eradicate forced labor slavery human trafficking targets mind world can achieve full productive employment decent work women men 2030 seven module massive open online course mooc provides depth look issues inclusive sustainable economic growth full productive employment decent work topics covered include structural shifts economies work informality gender child labor modern welfare state future work course concludes special module ilo realizing decent work achieving sdg 8 learn module 1 decent work sustainable development module 2 transitions employment work module 3 challenges work informality gender child labor module 4 current policy responses module 5 structural institutional models future work module 6 future jobs work module 7 special module partnership ilo achieving sdg 8 realizing decent work","take achiev sdg 8 realiz decent work link employ work incom wealth autom affect futur work take achiev sdg 8 realiz decent work link employ work incom wealth autom affect futur work examin work employ s structur shift trace rise modern welfar state ai reshap world work take achiev sdg 8 nation economi grown substanti sinc industri revolut 19th centuri yet peopl necessarili seen increas opportun find decent work earn decent incom fact place increas product rise profit associ autom direct impact avail decent job accord intern labour organ 204 million peopl unemploy 2015 600 million new job need 2030 just keep pace growth work age popul also need improv work condit 780 million women men employ earn enough lift famili poverti address core issu see increas decent work opportun also robust inclus poverti reduc growth cours explor past futur work context sdgs particular sdg 8 decent work econom growth examin state incom employ around world barrier employ polici promot econom opportun futur work rapid chang world encourag entrepreneurship job creation key achiev sdgs effect measur erad forc labor slaveri human traffick target mind world can achiev full product employ decent work women men 2030 seven modul massiv open onlin cours mooc provid depth look issu inclus sustain econom growth full product employ decent work topic cover includ structur shift economi work inform gender child labor modern welfar state futur work cours conclud special modul ilo realiz decent work achiev sdg 8 learn modul 1 decent work sustain develop modul 2 transit employ work modul 3 challeng work inform gender child labor modul 4 current polici respons modul 5 structur institut model futur work modul 6 futur job work modul 7 special modul partnership ilo achiev sdg 8 realiz decent work",100,3,10,8,4,"policy_coh_keystems"

Each module is oriented towards a clearly identified target group, and is geared towards the attainment of specific learning outcomes. Therefore, all modules have clearly delineated sub-units to enable step-by-step learning and exercises/ assignments to test knowledge attainments (including a case study, food for thought, group assignments and quizzes). Content of the modules is drawn from the regional research on e-government for women<U+0092>s empowerment in Asia and the Pacific conducted by UNESCAP and IT for Change in 2015-16; as well as a scan of open source documentation of good practices in gender and e-government in the region, and in other contexts.

In the implementation of this project, ESCAP has partnered with IT for Change, India (www.ITforChange.net). IT for Change is a not-for-profit organisation that seeks to build a socially just and gender-equitable information society for the global South. Towards this, it is engaged in policy research, advocacy and field practice in the domains of gender, digital technologies and development; ICTs in education; e-government; Internet governance, digital rights; and data for development. At IT for Change, this project was led by Anita Gurumurthy, Executive Director with support from Nandini Chami, Senior Research Associate.

This project has been made possible with the generous funding from the Government of the Republic of Korea, through the Korea-ESCAP Cooperation Fund (KECF).

About us

The Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) serves as the United Nations<U+0092> regional hub promoting cooperation among countries to achieve inclusive and sustainable development. The largest regional intergovernmental platform with 53 member States and 9 associate members, ESCAP has emerged as a strong regional think-tank offering countries sound analytical products that shed insight into the evolving economic, social and environmental dynamics of the region. The Commission<U+0092>s strategic focus is to deliver on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which it does by reinforcing and deepening regional cooperation and integration to advance connectivity, financial cooperation and market integration. ESCAP<U+0092>s research and analysis coupled with its policy advisory services, capacity building and technical assistance to governments aims to support countries<U+0092> sustainable and inclusive development ambitions.

The United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA)<U+00A0> promotes and supports international cooperation in the pursuit of sustainable development for all. It addresses a range of cross-cutting issues that affect peoples<U+0092> lives and livelihoods, especially the most vulnerable. In providing a broad range of analytical products, policy advice and technical assistance, UN DESA effectively translates global commitments in the economic, social and environmental spheres into national policies and actions and plays a key role in monitoring progress towards the 17 Sustainable Development Goals.
