"1","Planning for Climate Change in African Cities","Climate change poses a threat to economic growth and long-term prosperity of many countries around the world. Africa is not an exception, considering the actual and potential impacts of climate change and climate variability that will threaten its vulnerable sectors and human populations. African countries are projected to experience changing rainfall patterns, rising sea levels, and higher temperatures that will affect food security, agricultural production, water availability, and public health, among others. These climate change impacts and climate variability can further produce social and political problems, such as rural-urban migration and water resource disputes.   , Furthermore, the low levels of development in many African countries, as well as limited institutional, infrastructural, and technical capacities to respond successfully to climate change impacts and climate variability, can exacerbate the situation. In terms of contribution to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, although African countries are the lightest polluters, it has also become apparent that alternative energy sources can offset the increasing energy demand and dependence on biomass. Addressing climate change offers possibilities for low-carbon development. Moreover, there are promising mechanisms that can address both climate change actions and development goals simultaneously. 

At the city level, strengthening resilience, or the ability to respond to and absorb the effects of a hazardous event in a timely and efficient manner and to sustain this ability in the future, and adaptation; the process of adjusting to actual or expected climate change stimuli or their effects, should be at the forefront of planning.  Local governments have an important role to play through the provision of adequate infrastructure, regulation of land use, and other public services that are crucial for urban resilience. Mobilizing local governments, in collaboration with national governments, non-governmental organizations, and international organizations, among others, is also critical for an integrated multi-sectoral approach to climate change. 

The Course on Planning for Climate Change in African Cities provides the foundation for understanding cities<U+0092> exposure and sensitivity to climate change, and how cities can manage these impacts in the face of growing uncertainty. It does so by introducing the basic concepts of urban resilience and adaptation, by using illustrative case studies in different African cities. Furthermore, this module provides lectures on the different approaches for climate change planning, whether ad hoc, strategic or mainstreaming; introduces the different steps in the planning cycle <U+0096> from initial assessment to monitoring and evaluation; and presents the different decision support and assessment tools for prioritizing climate change actions. This course broadens the discussion on planning for climate change by engaging learners to apply their knowledge and practice their decision-making skills in a simulated exercise.

In line with development that minimizes the harm caused by climate change impacts, while maximizing the many human development opportunities presented by a more resilient future, we ask: what are the connections between urban risk and vulnerability? How is climate change and urban resilience conceptualized and applied in practice? Which policies and measures should be introduced to address climate change? Finally, how to choose among different measures that address climate change adaptation, urban resilience, and other development objectives?

"6","Climate Change and Water in Mountains: A Global Concern","What is climate change ? How are mountain regions affected by the evolution of water resources and their uses ? What kind of risks need to be considered ? , Mountains are recognized as particularly sensitive physical environments where intense and rapid changes have in the past, and may increasingly in the future, place pressure on their resource base. 

In this context, a team of roughly 100 experts worked from 2008 to 2013 for the European ACQWA project (www.acqwa.ch) which was coordinated by the University of Geneva. The primary objectives of the project were to assess the impacts of a changing climate on the quantity and quality of water originating in mountain regions, particularly where snow- and ice melt represent a large, sometimes the largest, streamflow component. A further objective of the project was to determine the potential disruptions to water-dependent economic activities related to the climate impacts on hydrological systems, and to propose a portfolio of possible adaptation strategies.

This particular MOOC is inspired by the ACQWA Project and offers a better understanding of climate change, its impacts on the quality and quantity of water in mountain regions and the risks related to changing water resources. From an interdisciplinary perspective, the participation of twenty-five instructors from five different countries (Switzerland, England, South Korea, India and Nepal) and fourteen institutions (UNIGE, RTS, UNIFR, UZH, ETHZ, Meteodat GmbH, WGMS, Imperial College London, Agroscope, R<e9>publique et Canton de Gen<e8>ve, Yonsei University, IHCAP, ICIMOD, SDC, FOEN) highlights the diversity of both theoretical and practical viewpoints related to these issues.

By the end of this course, you will be able :

- to define the general concept of climate change in mountain regions
- to understand the concepts associated with climate change such as adaptation and water governance strategies
- to consider the impacts of climate change on water resources in mountain regions
- to identify the impacts of climate change on hydropower, agriculture, aquatic ecosystems and health 
- to enumerate risks that can occur in mountain areas and lead to disruptions in water availability and use.

Your acquired knowledge will be evaluated through multiple-choice quizzes at the end of each unit of the course.

This MOOC on <U+0093>Climate Change and Water in Mountain Regions : A Global Concern<U+0094> was initiated and financed by the University of Geneva, through its Institute for Environmental Sciences.

"12","Climate Adaptation in Africa","This course explores why climate change adaptation is important in the African context. Africa is considered one to be one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change.   Historically, climate-related hazards such as drought, flooding, pest and disease outbreaks, coastal storms and heat waves have had devastating impacts on people and the environment in which they live. Often the damage knocks back progress that has been made in social and economic development, slowing down the achievement of development goals.  Climate models suggest that many of these climatic hazards will intensify as the global climate warms. Building resilience to climate risks, through adaptation, is critically important for future development in Africa., The course will examine adaptation in theory and in practice, through a focus on four sectors that are critically important for climate resilient development in Africa: Water Security, Agriculture and Food Security, Ecosystems and Ecosystem Services and Resilient Cities.","course explores climate change adaptation important african context africa considered one one vulnerable regions climate change historically climate related hazards drought flooding pest disease outbreaks coastal storms heat waves devastating impacts people environment live often damage knocks back progress made social economic development slowing achievement development goals climate models suggest many climatic hazards will intensify global climate warms building resilience climate risks adaptation critically important future development africa course will examine adaptation theory practice focus four sectors critically important climate resilient development africa water security agriculture food security ecosystems ecosystem services resilient cities","cours explor climat chang adapt import african context africa consid one one vulner region climat chang histor climat relat hazard drought flood pest diseas outbreak coastal storm heat wave devast impact peopl environ live often damag knock back progress made social econom develop slow achiev develop goal climat model suggest mani climat hazard will intensifi global climat warm build resili climat risk adapt critic import futur develop africa cours will examin adapt theori practic focus four sector critic import climat resili develop africa water secur agricultur food secur ecosystem ecosystem servic resili citi",12,0,2,2,5,"reflex_adpt_keystems"

As sustainability is a cross-disciplinary field of study, this foundation requires intellectual breadth: as I describe it in the class text, understanding our motivations requires the humanities, measuring the challenges of sustainability requires knowledge of the sciences (both natural and social), and building solutions requires technical insight into systems (such as provided by engineering, planning, and management).","course introduces academic approach sustainability explores today<U+393C><U+3E32>s human societies can endure face global change ecosystem degradation resource limitations course focuses key knowledge areas sustainability theory practice including population ecosystems global change energy agriculture water environmental economics policy ethics cultural history subject vital importance seeking uncover principles long term welfare peoples planet sustainability cross disciplinary field study foundation requires intellectual breadth describe class text understanding motivations requires humanities measuring challenges sustainability requires knowledge sciences natural social building solutions requires technical insight systems provided engineering planning management","cours introduc academ approach sustain explor today<U+393C><U+3E32> human societi can endur face global chang ecosystem degrad resourc limit cours focus key knowledg area sustain theori practic includ popul ecosystem global chang energi agricultur water environment econom polici ethic cultur histori subject vital import seek uncov principl long term welfar peopl planet sustain cross disciplinari field studi foundat requir intellectu breadth describ class text understand motiv requir human measur challeng sustain requir knowledg scienc natur social build solut requir technic insight system provid engin plan manag",15,1,3,5,1,"democratic_keystems"
"16","The Sustainable Development Goals <U+0096> A global, transdisciplinary vision for the future","In 2015, the UN launched the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Adopted by 193 member states, the goals represent an important international step in setting humanity on a trajectory towards sustainable development. Within this course, you will get a historical overview of how sustainability has been understood, as well as a thorough introduction to the SDGs <U+0096> what they are, how progress can be measured, and how the SDGs are relevant for the management of the global systems supporting humanity. The course will examine how various societal actors are responding to and implementing the SDGs. , While all of the SDGs are essential to sustainable development, SDG 13, Climate Action, is usually perceived as the most urgent in terms of the need for a swift implementation on a global scale. Therefore, particular focus is given to this SDG. Through the course, you will gain up-to-date knowledge of the current understanding of human impacts on the Earth at the planetary level. Progress towards establishing global management of human interactions with the climate system within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is also discussed.

The course is designed and taught by Professor Katherine Richardson, who is a member of the 15-person panel appointed by the UN General Secretary in 2016 to write the 2019 Global Sustainable Development Report. In each lecture, Katherine interviews experts who provide insights relevant to the topic at hand.","2015 un launched 17 sustainable development goals sdgs adopted 193 member states goals represent important international step setting humanity trajectory towards sustainable development within course will get historical overview sustainability understood well thorough introduction sdgs <U+393C><U+3E36> progress can measured sdgs relevant management global systems supporting humanity course will examine various societal actors responding implementing sdgs sdgs essential sustainable development sdg 13 climate action usually perceived urgent terms need swift implementation global scale therefore particular focus given sdg course will gain date knowledge current understanding human impacts earth planetary level progress towards establishing global management human interactions climate system within united nations framework convention climate change unfccc also discussed course designed taught professor katherine richardson member 15 person panel appointed un general secretary 2016 write 2019 global sustainable development report lecture katherine interviews experts provide insights relevant topic hand","2015 un launch 17 sustain develop goal sdgs adopt 193 member state goal repres import intern step set human trajectori toward sustain develop within cours will get histor overview sustain understood well thorough introduct sdgs <U+393C><U+3E36> progress can measur sdgs relev manag global system support human cours will examin various societ actor respond implement sdgs sdgs essenti sustain develop sdg 13 climat action usual perceiv urgent term need swift implement global scale therefor particular focus given sdg cours will gain date knowledg current understand human impact earth planetari level progress toward establish global manag human interact climat system within unit nation framework convent climat chang unfccc also discuss cours design taught professor katherin richardson member 15 person panel appoint un general secretari 2016 write 2019 global sustain develop report lectur katherin interview expert provid insight relev topic hand",16,5,7,4,7,"reflex_adpt_keystems"

This course, <U+0093>Beyond the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): Addressing Sustainability and Development,<U+0094> is the first course in the Sustainability and Development MasterTrack<U+00AE> Certificate, but you can also take this course as a stand-alone learning opportunity. , Sustainability and development pose unprecedented challenges as human societies grow and seek to ensure future wellbeing and prosperity. In this course, we<U+0092>ll focus on addressing the twin challenges of sustainability and development with actionable knowledge for innovating solutions to the world<U+0092>s most pressing problems like climate change, poverty and inequality, and biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation. Rather than sustainability being a qualifier for development (e.g. sustainable development), we conceptualize Sustainability and Development as co-equal fields of inquiry and action that seek to build bridges between the natural, social and applied sciences and the humanities. When sustainability and development are placed on an equal footing, it requires us to think more explicitly about the trade-offs, co-benefits and synergies between them, which we will be exploring in depth in each week.

Throughout the course, you will be introduced to the theoretical currents in Sustainability and Development, and will garner an in-depth understanding of the United Nations<U+0092> 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We will also consider the methods and skills necessary for designing innovative solutions to sustainability and development problems through the emerging field of Sustainability Science.

In this course, we will explore three of the most pressing challenges undergirding the  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) including climate change, poverty and inequality, and ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss, with case studies to guide and challenge our thinking. In the final week of the course, we will discuss the trade-offs, co-benefits and synergies between these challenges, especially as they relate to designing innovative solutions for achieving  our sustainability and development goals.

By the end of this course, you will be able to:
1. Understand and explain the world<U+0092>s most pressing problems with a specific focus on poverty & inequality, ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss, and climate change.
2. Critically analyze the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and their relationship to the world<U+0092>s most pressing problems.
3. Use frameworks and evidence necessary to develop solutions.
4. Assess relevant solutions that would help realize the SDGs and at the same time solve the pressing problems.

"25","Global Energy and Climate Policy","The Global Energy and Climate Policy course offers an introduction to the theoretical and practical understanding of how energy and climate change policies are designed, shaped, advocated and implemented. As energy markets go truly global, domestic energy policies are becoming more and more entangled with wider issues of international governance. Concurrently, the urgent need to mitigate and adapt to climate change and transition to a low-carbon future is adding a further layer of complexity. , The course is aimed broadly at people interested in learning more about interconnected issues in energy and climate policy globally. It assumes a level of interest but no necessary previous knowledge. However, the course also offers sufficient up to date research and new critical perspectives to be of interest to people with expertise in or academic familiarity with the topic as well. 

The main aim of the course is to provide this wide-ranging introduction in a self-contained, but in-depth form, alongside the important practical skills necessary to understand and discuss energy and climate policy, and lay the groundwork for greater engagement in the future <U+0096> either through academic study, in the public, private or not-for-profit sectors.","global energy climate policy course offers introduction theoretical practical understanding energy climate change policies designed shaped advocated implemented energy markets go truly global domestic energy policies becoming entangled wider issues international governance concurrently urgent need mitigate adapt climate change transition low carbon future adding layer complexity course aimed broadly people interested learning interconnected issues energy climate policy globally assumes level interest necessary previous knowledge however course also offers sufficient date research new critical perspectives interest people expertise academic familiarity topic well main aim course provide wide ranging introduction self contained depth form alongside important practical skills necessary understand discuss energy climate policy lay groundwork greater engagement future <U+393C><U+3E36> either academic study public private profit sectors","global energi climat polici cours offer introduct theoret practic understand energi climat chang polici design shape advoc implement energi market go truli global domest energi polici becom entangl wider issu intern govern concurr urgent need mitig adapt climat chang transit low carbon futur ad layer complex cours aim broad peopl interest learn interconnect issu energi climat polici global assum level interest necessari previous knowledg howev cours also offer suffici date research new critic perspect interest peopl expertis academ familiar topic well main aim cours provid wide rang introduct self contain depth form alongsid import practic skill necessari understand discuss energi climat polici lay groundwork greater engag futur <U+393C><U+3E36> either academ studi public privat profit sector",25,4,6,4,2,"policy_coh_keystems"

This MOOC is at the junction between the development of Southern countries and sustainable development. 
It has: 
1) a macroeconomic and financial dimension, developed by Gael Giraud and Alain Grandjean; 
2) an ecological and climatic dimension, developed by David Claessen and ENS speakers; and 
3) a focus on Southern countries, developed by AFD speakers.

Here are the learning goals for the entire training program:

Goal 1: Be able to understand the relationship between the energy transition, the ecological transition, the role of energy in our economy, our economic development model, and financing issues. 
Goal 2: Know how to advocate for and lobby on issues and on the need to change reality in order to implement strategies and action plans.
Goal 3: Be able to make a link between the Energy transition and financing solutions, and between comprehension and action.  
No one questions the imperative need to ensure development based on personal well-being and a fair distribution of wealth.

The Challenges of a Transition for All  
Until now the development of Northern countries has been based on an increasing exploitation of energy resources and a greater freedom of trade and exchange at the global scale. We now know that such a model is no longer sustainable, due to global warming and to the overexploitation of resources, which lead to health, social, and environmental disasters.

The Role of Developing Countries
With that in mind, how can we ensure fair and equitable growth for all? What role do countries from the different regions in the South have to play in this complete upheaval of the current economic, trade, and political models in order to achieve an effective energy and ecological transition?
  
A MOOC to Respond to these Questions
This free online training offers complementary perspectives from several specialists of issues related to climate change and the development of Southern countries. They will share their very practical understanding of the current crises and the answers that can be provided. Participants will learn from studies by:
<U+0095> Researchers from the prestigious <c9>cole Normale Sup<e9>rieure in Paris
<U+0095> Field experts from the Agence Fran<e7>aise de D<e9>veloppement, a funding agency that has been committed to helping developing countries for 75 years,

"30","SEEA Experimental Ecosystem Accounting","_The SEEA EEA constitutes an integrated statistical framework for organizing biophysical data, measuring ecosystem services, tracking changes in ecosystem assets and linking this information to economic and other human activity. The SEEA EEA complements the SEEA Central Framework by taking a different perspective. The Central Framework looks at <U+0093>individual environmental assets<U+0094>, such as water resources, energy resources, etc. and how those assets move between the environment and the economy. In contrast, the SEEA EEA takes the perspective of ecosystems and considers how individual environmental assets interact as part of natural processes within a given spatial area. Ecosystem accounting takes a spatial approach, often utilizing earth observation and geospatial data. Using this spatial approach, the SEEA EEA accounts for the extent and condition of ecosystems, the flow of services provided by ecosystems and the contributions and benefits of ecosystems to economic and other human activity.
This course provides an overview of the SEEA EEA, including how the SEEA EEA can be used for policy. The course covers ecosystem extent, condition and service accounts as well as accounting for biodiversity, water and carbon.
The course is self-paced without instruction and can be taken at any point in time.
The course is available in English and Spanish.

The Central Framework looks at <U+0093>individual environmental assets<U+0094>, such as water resources, energy resources, etc. and how those assets move between the environment and the economy. In contrast, the SEEA EEA takes the perspective of ecosystems and considers how individual environmental assets interact as part of natural processes within a given spatial area. Ecosystem accounting takes a spatial approach, often utilizing earth observation and geospatial data. Using this spatial approach, the SEEA EEA accounts for the extent and condition of ecosystems, the flow of services provided by ecosystems and the contributions and benefits of ecosystems to economic and other human activity., This course provides an overview of the SEEA EEA, including how the SEEA EEA can be used for policy. The course covers ecosystem extent, condition and service accounts as well as accounting for biodiversity, water and carbon., The course is self-paced without instruction and can be taken at any point in time., The course is available in English and Spanish., 
					Target audience
					The target audience includes compilers (and potential compilers) of SEEA EEA accounts. The target audience also includes ministries or experts which provide data used in SEEA EEA accounts. Policy analysts may also find this course useful.

"33","Integration of the SDGs into National Planning","_The e-learning course on the Integration of the SDGs into National Planning was developed by UN ESCAP to support policy makers and sustainable development practitioners in development of strategies and plans to implement the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development and the SDGs.
The complex and aspirational 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), require multidisciplinary methods for developing implementation strategies because of their <U+0093>indivisible whole<U+0094> nature. Furthermore, the 17 Sustainable Development Goals and their targets are closely interlinked and require innovative and unconventional policy approaches, such as those focusing on the intersections (meeting points), interlinkages and complex causal relationships. This e-Learning course deals with the aspects of <U+0092>Why<U+0092> and <U+0091>How<U+0092> of integration and ESCAP methodologies and tools to aid integrated and interlinked policy making process.
The course consists of three modules, which give insights on the importance of the integration of the three dimensions of sustainable development, and provide further guidance on available tools and their application for policy making and implementation.
The first module on Integration of the Three Dimensions of Sustainable Development is based on the UN ESCAP publication with correlating title <U+0096> Integrating the three dimensions of sustainable development: A framework and tools. The module defines and articulates to policy makers the essence of integration of the three dimensions of sustainable developmentnamely economic, social and environmental, across the policy cycle.
The second module on Systems Thinking Framework to Support the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development and the SDGs provides an overview of systems thinking methodology and school of thought, a step-by-step guide to systems thinking modelling and examples of application in countries of the Asia-Pacific region. The module also briefly introduces the ESCAP experience in applying systems thinking to SDG integration analysis and provides examples and case studies from contributing partners.
The third module on ESCAP<U+0092>s Methodology for Applying Systems Thinking in Asia-Pacific Countries for Integrating SDG 6 into National Planning describes the practical application of the ESCAP analytical framework for integration of SDG 6 on Clean Water and Sanitation with the other 16 SDGs at the target level and builds on the Analytical Framework for Integration of Water and Sanitation SDGs and Targets Using Systems Thinking Approach. The module also describes the practical application of the methodology in pilot countries and lessons learned.

"35","SEEA: In-depth Training on Water Accounting","_The System of Environmental-Economic Accounts for Water (SEEA-Water) is an integrated approach to water monitoring, bringing together a wide range of water related statistics across sectors into one coherent information system. The SEEA-Water is the conceptual framework and set of accounts which presents hydrological information alongside economic information in a consistent way. The SEEA-Water is consistent with the SEEA Central Framework and follows a similar accounting structure to the System of National Accounts (SNA). The SEEA-Water uses concepts, definitions and classifications consistent with the SNA in order to facilitate the integration of environmental and economic statistics. By doing so, the SEEA-Water allows us to develop indicators and conduct analysis on the economy-environment nexus, with a focus on water.
The SEEA-Water facilitates better informed decision-making, particularly for integrated water resources management. The SEEA-Water offers a means of monitoring pressures exerted by the economy on the environment, in terms of abstraction of water from the environment; impacts in terms of changes in stocks of water; and how the economy responds in terms of expenditure on environmental protection and resource management. The SEEA-Water does not propose particular indicators, but is instead a holistic multi-purpose information system that can generate a wide range of statistics and indicators with varying potential analytical applications. For example, Goal 6 of the SDGs focuses specifically on water and includes calls for improving water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping and the release of hazardous materials, reducing the proportion of untreated wastewater and increasing recycling and safe reuse of water. The SEEA-Water methodology can play an important role in measuring these targets by providing a framework for the development of indicators.
The course is self-paced without instruction and can be taken at any point in time.
The course is available in English and Arabic.

The SEEA-Water does not propose particular indicators, but is instead a holistic multi-purpose information system that can generate a wide range of statistics and indicators with varying potential analytical applications. For example, Goal 6 of the SDGs focuses specifically on water and includes calls for improving water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping and the release of hazardous materials, reducing the proportion of untreated wastewater and increasing recycling and safe reuse of water. The SEEA-Water methodology can play an important role in measuring these targets by providing a framework for the development of indicators., The course is self-paced without instruction and can be taken at any point in time., The course is available in English and Arabic., 
					Target audience

The SEEA framework follows a similar accounting structure to the System of National Accounts (SNA). The SEEA uses concepts, definitions and classifications consistent with the SNA in order to facilitate the integration of environmental and economic statistics. By doing so, the SEEA allows us to develop indicators and conduct analysis on the economy-environment nexus.
The SEEA facilitates better informed decision-making. The SEEA Central Framework offers a means of monitoring pressures exerted by the economy on the environment, in terms of abstraction of natural resources and emissions; impacts in terms of changes in stocks of natural resources; and how the economy responds in terms of expenditure on environmental protection and resource management. The SEEA does not propose particular indicators, but is instead a holistic multi-purpose information system that can generate a wide range of statistics and indicators with varying potential analytical applications.
The course is self-paced without instruction and can be taken at any point in time.
The course is available in Arabic, English, French, Russian and Spanish.

Among the priorities agreed upon by member states is social protection<U+00A0><U+0097><U+00A0>cited in the agenda as a primary means to protect all individuals and families against social contingencies and market risks across the life-cycle.

Currently, an estimated 69.4 per cent of the world<U+0092>s population lives without adequate social protection coverage, including lack of access to a pension, unemployment benefits, health insurance, and income guarantees.

It is therefore time to accelerate the transformation of social protection systems in light of the pandemic, to ensure human-centred recovery and resilience.
The ambitious objectives of the 2030 Agenda and the newfound drive for building comprehensive social protection systems will require concerted efforts from across the spectrum of UN and national actors, joining up disparate interventions and leveraging new tools to build enhanced social protection programmes and achieve the 2030 target.

"52","SEEA Experimental Ecosystem Accounting","_The SEEA EEA constitutes an integrated statistical framework for organizing biophysical data, measuring ecosystem services, tracking changes in ecosystem assets and linking this information to economic and other human activity. The SEEA EEA complements the SEEA Central Framework by taking a different perspective. The Central Framework looks at <U+0093>individual environmental assets<U+0094>, such as water resources, energy resources, etc. and how those assets move between the environment and the economy. In contrast, the SEEA EEA takes the perspective of ecosystems and considers how individual environmental assets interact as part of natural processes within a given spatial area. Ecosystem accounting takes a spatial approach, often utilizing earth observation and geospatial data. Using this spatial approach, the SEEA EEA accounts for the extent and condition of ecosystems, the flow of services provided by ecosystems and the contributions and benefits of ecosystems to economic and other human activity.
This course provides an overview of the SEEA EEA, including how the SEEA EEA can be used for policy. The course covers ecosystem extent, condition and service accounts as well as accounting for biodiversity, water and carbon.
The course is self-paced without instruction and can be taken at any point in time.
The course is available in English and Spanish.

"55","Integration of the SDGs into National Planning","_The e-learning course on the Integration of the SDGs into National Planning was developed by UN ESCAP to support policy makers and sustainable development practitioners in development of strategies and plans to implement the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development and the SDGs.
The complex and aspirational 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), require multidisciplinary methods for developing implementation strategies because of their <U+0093>indivisible whole<U+0094> nature. Furthermore, the 17 Sustainable Development Goals and their targets are closely interlinked and require innovative and unconventional policy approaches, such as those focusing on the intersections (meeting points), interlinkages and complex causal relationships. This e-Learning course deals with the aspects of <U+0092>Why<U+0092> and <U+0091>How<U+0092> of integration and ESCAP methodologies and tools to aid integrated and interlinked policy making process.
The course consists of three modules, which give insights on the importance of the integration of the three dimensions of sustainable development, and provide further guidance on available tools and their application for policy making and implementation.
The first module on Integration of the Three Dimensions of Sustainable Development is based on the UN ESCAP publication with correlating title <U+0096> Integrating the three dimensions of sustainable development: A framework and tools. The module defines and articulates to policy makers the essence of integration of the three dimensions of sustainable developmentnamely economic, social and environmental, across the policy cycle.
The second module on Systems Thinking Framework to Support the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development and the SDGs provides an overview of systems thinking methodology and school of thought, a step-by-step guide to systems thinking modelling and examples of application in countries of the Asia-Pacific region. The module also briefly introduces the ESCAP experience in applying systems thinking to SDG integration analysis and provides examples and case studies from contributing partners.
The third module on ESCAP<U+0092>s Methodology for Applying Systems Thinking in Asia-Pacific Countries for Integrating SDG 6 into National Planning describes the practical application of the ESCAP analytical framework for integration of SDG 6 on Clean Water and Sanitation with the other 16 SDGs at the target level and builds on the Analytical Framework for Integration of Water and Sanitation SDGs and Targets Using Systems Thinking Approach. The module also describes the practical application of the methodology in pilot countries and lessons learned.

"57","SEEA: In-depth Training on Water Accounting","_The System of Environmental-Economic Accounts for Water (SEEA-Water) is an integrated approach to water monitoring, bringing together a wide range of water related statistics across sectors into one coherent information system. The SEEA-Water is the conceptual framework and set of accounts which presents hydrological information alongside economic information in a consistent way. The SEEA-Water is consistent with the SEEA Central Framework and follows a similar accounting structure to the System of National Accounts (SNA). The SEEA-Water uses concepts, definitions and classifications consistent with the SNA in order to facilitate the integration of environmental and economic statistics. By doing so, the SEEA-Water allows us to develop indicators and conduct analysis on the economy-environment nexus, with a focus on water.
The SEEA-Water facilitates better informed decision-making, particularly for integrated water resources management. The SEEA-Water offers a means of monitoring pressures exerted by the economy on the environment, in terms of abstraction of water from the environment; impacts in terms of changes in stocks of water; and how the economy responds in terms of expenditure on environmental protection and resource management. The SEEA-Water does not propose particular indicators, but is instead a holistic multi-purpose information system that can generate a wide range of statistics and indicators with varying potential analytical applications. For example, Goal 6 of the SDGs focuses specifically on water and includes calls for improving water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping and the release of hazardous materials, reducing the proportion of untreated wastewater and increasing recycling and safe reuse of water. The SEEA-Water methodology can play an important role in measuring these targets by providing a framework for the development of indicators.
The course is self-paced without instruction and can be taken at any point in time.
The course is available in English and Arabic.

By providing an internationally agreed standard with agreed concepts, definitions and classifications, the SEEA is an invaluable tool for compiling integrated statistics on the economy and the environment. The SEEA framework follows a similar accounting structure to the System of National Accounts (SNA). The SEEA uses concepts, definitions and classifications consistent with the SNA in order to facilitate the integration of environmental and economic statistics. By doing so, the SEEA allows us to develop indicators and conduct analysis on the economy-environment nexus.
The SEEA facilitates better informed decision-making. The SEEA Central Framework offers a means of monitoring pressures exerted by the economy on the environment, in terms of abstraction of natural resources and emissions; impacts in terms of changes in stocks of natural resources; and how the economy responds in terms of expenditure on environmental protection and resource management. The SEEA does not propose particular indicators, but is instead a holistic multi-purpose information system that can generate a wide range of statistics and indicators with varying potential analytical applications.
The course is self-paced without instruction and can be taken at any point in time.
The course is available in Arabic, English, French, Russian and Spanish.

How can transboundary water cooperation play a role in leading to peace?, is pivotal for , FRESHWATER SECURITY, as a, TOP PRIORITY, in , TRANSBOUNDARY WATER MANAGEMENT, to address , WATER SECURITY CHALLENGES, Freshwater scarcity, stress, and crisis are increasing worldwide. More than a billion people live in water-scarce regions, and 3.5 billion could experience water scarcity by 2025. These pressures disproportionally affect vulnerable and marginalized people, including those living in poverty and displacement. Rising pollution levels accelerate the crisis by reducing water availability for human use and impacting aquatic life in rivers, lakes, aquifers, and the oceans., Transboundary basins account for roughly 60% of freshwater resources, serving 2.8 billion people, or 42% of the world<U+0092>s population. Complex shared transboundary freshwater and ecosystems cut across myriad sectoral needs, themes, and political boundaries. Setting effective policy goals, coupled with investments, means working at multiple scales with a range of public and private stakeholders throughout the watershed, from source to sea and beyond., This course presents multiple facets of governance for transboundary freshwater security <U+0096> from financing mechanisms to negotiation skills <U+0096> while emphasizing the urgency of sustainable development and cooperation at many levels. It extends from basic building blocks and concepts to advanced thinking about transboundary governance, and applies theory to practice through examples and case studies. Topics covered in six modules range from the fundamentals of transboundary water security to international water law, water diplomacy, negotiations, institutions, management tools, and sustainable finance., The course is designed for professionals who manage and make decisions about transboundary waters within line ministries and river basin organizations; managers of transboundary water projects and the Global Environment Facility (GEF) International Waters Portfolio; the GEF IW:LEARN Network; NGOs, academics, and private sector actors working on basin management; development practitioners; young professionals and future leaders in transboundary waters, including undergraduate and graduate students; and anyone else who is keen to learn about the topic., This MOOC was produced by the Global Water Partnership in collaboration with GEF IW:LEARN and its partners. Over 80 water professionals from around the world brought their experiences to lectures and case studies.

The SDGs are interconnected, recognizing that poverty cannot be eradicated without improved health and education, sustainable economic growth cannot occur on a planet under threat of climate change, and so forth., Goal 1, <U+0093>End poverty in all its forms everywhere,<U+0094> calls on stakeholders at every level to drastically reduce the number of people living in poverty, provide services and assistance to those in need, and ensure the resilience of the poor and vulnerable in times of crisis. SDG 1 builds on earlier calls to cut poverty in lower-income countries by, first, calling for the elimination of extreme poverty worldwide by 2030, and for every country to cut all dimensions of nationally-defined poverty by half by the same date. Goal 1 further draws linkages between poverty and climate disasters, and sets targets for social protection, resource mobilization and policy development. Likewise, Goal 10, <U+0093>Reduce inequality within and among countries,<U+0094> calls on stakeholders at all levels to empower the economic, political, and social inclusion of all people; and for governments to work together to provide pathways of opportunity across the world., This course will present an overview of the definitions, scale, and scope of different forms of poverty and inequality across the world. It will examine links between poverty, inequality, and well-being; opportunities for socioeconomic mobility; the particular challenges facing women, minorities, Indigenous people, and vulnerable populations; and how poverty and inequality link to issues like climate change, migration, and conflict. Finally, the course will conclude with a look at policy approaches and tools for addressing poverty and inequality in a variety of contexts.,   Understanding Poverty and Inequality was created by the SDG Academy in partnership with the Center for Sustainable Development at the Brookings Institution.,  Module 1: An Introduction to Poverty and Inequality,  Module 2: Multidimensional Measures of Poverty,  Module 3: Explaining Global Inequality,  Module 4:Poverty and Subjective Well-being,  Module 5: Identity and Exclusion,  Module 6: Poverty and Inequality, Today and Tomorrow","mean <U+393C><U+3E33>poverty<U+393C><U+3E34> <U+393C><U+3E33>inequality<U+393C><U+3E34> will take achieve sdg 1 poverty sdg 10 reduced inequalities 2030 mean <U+393C><U+3E33>poverty<U+393C><U+3E34> <U+393C><U+3E33>inequality<U+393C><U+3E34> will take achieve sdg 1 poverty sdg 10 reduced inequalities 2030 causes poverty inequality remaining challenges poverty reduction around world help ensure one left behind september 2015 193 member states united nations adopted 2030 agenda sustainable development committed 17 sustainable development goals sdgs sdgs interconnected recognizing poverty eradicated without improved health education sustainable economic growth occur planet threat climate change forth goal 1 <U+393C><U+3E33>end poverty forms everywhere <U+393C><U+3E34> calls stakeholders every level drastically reduce number people living poverty provide services assistance need ensure resilience poor vulnerable times crisis sdg 1 builds earlier calls cut poverty lower income countries first calling elimination extreme poverty worldwide 2030 every country cut dimensions nationally defined poverty half date goal 1 draws linkages poverty climate disasters sets targets social protection resource mobilization policy development likewise goal 10 <U+393C><U+3E33>reduce inequality within among countries <U+393C><U+3E34> calls stakeholders levels empower economic political social inclusion people governments work together provide pathways opportunity across world course will present overview definitions scale scope different forms poverty inequality across world will examine links poverty inequality well opportunities socioeconomic mobility particular challenges facing women minorities indigenous people vulnerable populations poverty inequality link issues like climate change migration conflict finally course will conclude look policy approaches tools addressing poverty inequality variety contexts understanding poverty inequality created sdg academy partnership center sustainable development brookings institution module 1 introduction poverty inequality module 2 multidimensional measures poverty module 3 explaining global inequality module 4 poverty subjective well module 5 identity exclusion module 6 poverty inequality today tomorrow","mean <U+393C><U+3E33>poverty<U+393C><U+3E34> <U+393C><U+3E33>inequality<U+393C><U+3E34> will take achiev sdg 1 poverti sdg 10 reduc inequ 2030 mean <U+393C><U+3E33>poverty<U+393C><U+3E34> <U+393C><U+3E33>inequality<U+393C><U+3E34> will take achiev sdg 1 poverti sdg 10 reduc inequ 2030 caus poverti inequ remain challeng poverti reduct around world help ensur one left behind septemb 2015 193 member state unit nation adopt 2030 agenda sustain develop commit 17 sustain develop goal sdgs sdgs interconnect recogn poverti erad without improv health educ sustain econom growth occur planet threat climat chang forth goal 1 <U+393C><U+3E33>end poverti form everywher <U+393C><U+3E34> call stakehold everi level drastic reduc number peopl live poverti provid servic assist need ensur resili poor vulner time crisi sdg 1 build earlier call cut poverti lower incom countri first call elimin extrem poverti worldwid 2030 everi countri cut dimens nation defin poverti half date goal 1 draw linkag poverti climat disast set target social protect resourc mobil polici develop likewis goal 10 <U+393C><U+3E33>reduc inequ within among countri <U+393C><U+3E34> call stakehold level empow econom polit social inclus peopl govern work togeth provid pathway opportun across world cours will present overview definit scale scope differ form poverti inequ across world will examin link poverti inequ well opportun socioeconom mobil particular challeng face women minor indigen peopl vulner popul poverti inequ link issu like climat chang migrat conflict final cours will conclud look polici approach tool address poverti inequ varieti context understand poverti inequ creat sdg academi partnership center sustain develop brook institut modul 1 introduct poverti inequ modul 2 multidimension measur poverti modul 3 explain global inequ modul 4 poverti subject well modul 5 ident exclus modul 6 poverti inequ today tomorrow",75,7,11,12,1,"democratic_keystems"

How will automation affect the future of work?, Examine work and employment's, STRUCTURAL SHIFTS, Trace the rise of a modern, WELFARE STATE, How will AI reshape the, WORLD OF WORK?, What does it take to, ACHIEVE SDG 8?, National economies have grown substantially since the Industrial Revolution of the 19th century, yet people have not necessarily seen an increase in opportunities to find decent work or earn a decent income. In fact, in some places, the increased productivity and rising profits associated with automation have directly impacted the availability of decent jobs. According to the International Labour Organization, more than 204 million people were unemployed in 2015, and more than 600 million new jobs are needed by 2030 just to keep pace with the growth of the working-age population. We also need to improve working conditions for the 780 million women and men who are employed but not earning enough to lift themselves and their families out of poverty. In addressing these core issues we will not only see increasing decent work opportunities but also more robust, inclusive and poverty-reducing growth., This course explores the past and future of work in the context of the SDGs, particularly SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth. It examines the state of income and employment around the world, barriers to employment, policies to promote economic opportunity, and the future of work in our rapidly changing world. Encouraging entrepreneurship and job creation are key to achieving the SDGs, as are effective measures to eradicate forced labor, slavery, and human trafficking. With these targets in mind, the world can achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men by 2030., This seven-module massive open online course (MOOC) provides an in-depth look at the issues of inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all. The topics covered include structural shifts in economies and work; informality, gender, and child labor; the modern welfare state; the future of work; and more. The course concludes with a special module by the ILO on realizing decent work for all and achieving SDG 8., You will learn about:,  Module 1: Decent Work for Sustainable Development,  Module 2: Transitions in Employment and Work,  Module 3: Challenges of Work: Informality, Gender and Child Labor,  Module 4: Current Policy Responses,  Module 5: Structural and Institutional Models for the Future of Work,  Module 6: Future of Jobs and Work,  Module 7: Special Module in Partnership with the ILO: Achieving SDG 8 and Realizing Decent Work for All","take achieve sdg 8 realize decent work link employment work income wealth will automation affect future work take achieve sdg 8 realize decent work link employment work income wealth will automation affect future work examine work employment s structural shifts trace rise modern welfare state will ai reshape world work take achieve sdg 8 national economies grown substantially since industrial revolution 19th century yet people necessarily seen increase opportunities find decent work earn decent income fact places increased productivity rising profits associated automation directly impacted availability decent jobs according international labour organization 204 million people unemployed 2015 600 million new jobs needed 2030 just keep pace growth working age population also need improve working conditions 780 million women men employed earning enough lift families poverty addressing core issues will see increasing decent work opportunities also robust inclusive poverty reducing growth course explores past future work context sdgs particularly sdg 8 decent work economic growth examines state income employment around world barriers employment policies promote economic opportunity future work rapidly changing world encouraging entrepreneurship job creation key achieving sdgs effective measures eradicate forced labor slavery human trafficking targets mind world can achieve full productive employment decent work women men 2030 seven module massive open online course mooc provides depth look issues inclusive sustainable economic growth full productive employment decent work topics covered include structural shifts economies work informality gender child labor modern welfare state future work course concludes special module ilo realizing decent work achieving sdg 8 will learn module 1 decent work sustainable development module 2 transitions employment work module 3 challenges work informality gender child labor module 4 current policy responses module 5 structural institutional models future work module 6 future jobs work module 7 special module partnership ilo achieving sdg 8 realizing decent work","take achiev sdg 8 realiz decent work link employ work incom wealth will autom affect futur work take achiev sdg 8 realiz decent work link employ work incom wealth will autom affect futur work examin work employ s structur shift trace rise modern welfar state will ai reshap world work take achiev sdg 8 nation economi grown substanti sinc industri revolut 19th centuri yet peopl necessarili seen increas opportun find decent work earn decent incom fact place increas product rise profit associ autom direct impact avail decent job accord intern labour organ 204 million peopl unemploy 2015 600 million new job need 2030 just keep pace growth work age popul also need improv work condit 780 million women men employ earn enough lift famili poverti address core issu will see increas decent work opportun also robust inclus poverti reduc growth cours explor past futur work context sdgs particular sdg 8 decent work econom growth examin state incom employ around world barrier employ polici promot econom opportun futur work rapid chang world encourag entrepreneurship job creation key achiev sdgs effect measur erad forc labor slaveri human traffick target mind world can achiev full product employ decent work women men 2030 seven modul massiv open onlin cours mooc provid depth look issu inclus sustain econom growth full product employ decent work topic cover includ structur shift economi work inform gender child labor modern welfar state futur work cours conclud special modul ilo realiz decent work achiev sdg 8 will learn modul 1 decent work sustain develop modul 2 transit employ work modul 3 challeng work inform gender child labor modul 4 current polici respons modul 5 structur institut model futur work modul 6 futur job work modul 7 special modul partnership ilo achiev sdg 8 realiz decent work",82,3,10,10,2,"democratic_keystems"

"111","Transforming Development: The Science and Practice of Resilience Thinking","Explore how concepts from resilience may help us rethink and transform current development practice. , Explore how concepts from resilience may help us rethink and transform current development practice. , Analyse the latest issues and debates about global environmental change, sustainability, and resilience, , Understand complexity and complex systems in ways that help analyze the world and diverse development contexts, , Identify cutting-edge and surprising ways that core concepts of resilience thinking can be applied in practice, , Understand the evolution of resilience thinking tools, and master those that can support your own activities, , With concerns about climate and global environmental changes, extreme events, and increases in social, economic, and political shocks, the concept of resilience is proving popular across a range of sectors as a way to understand and respond to our surprise-riddled world., Resilience thinking includes the ability to persist in the face of challenges, adapt to new realities, or transform to fundamentally new paths for development. Resilience thinking is more than a theory, more than a set of tools. It is a way of seeing the world, offering a new perspective of how change in the world happens. Resilience thinking provides a new approach for building understanding and taking action in a complex world that is deeply interconnected and ever-changing. A world where controlled, planned approaches, existing knowledge and current solutions are not enough to effectively respond to the challenges in a highly dynamic and uncertain future. Addressing poverty, injustice, and inequality, and advancing human well-being remains a major ambition and challenge for the 21st century, and it now needs to take into account that development will happen in a context radically different from the past., This course includes case studies and examples from practitioners who are working with resilience concepts in diverse contexts around the world. It is supported by strong scientific evidence and committed to being a platform to bring together and spark collaboration between individuals and organizations from around the world who are driven to transform development.,  ,  Module 1: Setting the Scene - Development in a changing world,  Module 2: Why does the world seem so complex?,  Module 3: Transformations and innovation for rethinking development practice,  Module 4: The journey from theory to practice,  Module 5: Reconnecting the social-ecological-cultural for rethinking development practice,  Module 6: Why the global matters for transforming development practice,  Module 7: Alternative futures for development practice,","explore concepts resilience may help us rethink transform current development practice explore concepts resilience may help us rethink transform current development practice analyse latest issues debates global environmental change sustainability resilience understand complexity complex systems ways help analyze world diverse development contexts identify cutting edge surprising ways core concepts resilience thinking can applied practice understand evolution resilience thinking tools master can support activities concerns climate global environmental changes extreme events increases social economic political shocks concept resilience proving popular across range sectors way understand respond surprise riddled world resilience thinking includes ability persist face challenges adapt new realities transform fundamentally new paths development resilience thinking theory set tools way seeing world offering new perspective change world happens resilience thinking provides new approach building understanding taking action complex world deeply interconnected ever changing world controlled planned approaches existing knowledge current solutions enough effectively respond challenges highly dynamic uncertain future addressing poverty injustice inequality advancing human well remains major ambition challenge 21st century now needs take account development will happen context radically different past course includes case studies examples practitioners working resilience concepts diverse contexts around world supported strong scientific evidence committed platform bring together spark collaboration individuals organizations around world driven transform development module 1 setting scene development changing world module 2 world seem complex module 3 transformations innovation rethinking development practice module 4 journey theory practice module 5 reconnecting social ecological cultural rethinking development practice module 6 global matters transforming development practice module 7 alternative futures development practice","explor concept resili may help us rethink transform current develop practic explor concept resili may help us rethink transform current develop practic analys latest issu debat global environment chang sustain resili understand complex complex system way help analyz world divers develop context identifi cut edg surpris way core concept resili think can appli practic understand evolut resili think tool master can support activ concern climat global environment chang extrem event increas social econom polit shock concept resili prove popular across rang sector way understand respond surpris riddl world resili think includ abil persist face challeng adapt new realiti transform fundament new path develop resili think theori set tool way see world offer new perspect chang world happen resili think provid new approach build understand take action complex world deepli interconnect ever chang world control plan approach exist knowledg current solut enough effect respond challeng high dynam uncertain futur address poverti injustic inequ advanc human well remain major ambit challeng 21st centuri now need take account develop will happen context radic differ past cours includ case studi exampl practition work resili concept divers context around world support strong scientif evid commit platform bring togeth spark collabor individu organ around world driven transform develop modul 1 set scene develop chang world modul 2 world seem complex modul 3 transform innov rethink develop practic modul 4 journey theori practic modul 5 reconnect social ecolog cultur rethink develop practic modul 6 global matter transform develop practic modul 7 altern futur develop practic",111,8,14,10,3,"policy_coh_keystems"
