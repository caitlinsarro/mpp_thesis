"1",1,"Planning for Climate Change in African Cities","Climate change poses a threat to economic growth and long-term prosperity of many countries around the world. Africa is not an exception, considering the actual and potential impacts of climate change and climate variability that will threaten its vulnerable sectors and human populations. African countries are projected to experience changing rainfall patterns, rising sea levels, and higher temperatures that will affect food security, agricultural production, water availability, and public health, among others. These climate change impacts and climate variability can further produce social and political problems, such as rural-urban migration and water resource disputes.   , Furthermore, the low levels of development in many African countries, as well as limited institutional, infrastructural, and technical capacities to respond successfully to climate change impacts and climate variability, can exacerbate the situation. In terms of contribution to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, although African countries are the lightest polluters, it has also become apparent that alternative energy sources can offset the increasing energy demand and dependence on biomass. Addressing climate change offers possibilities for low-carbon development. Moreover, there are promising mechanisms that can address both climate change actions and development goals simultaneously. 

At the city level, strengthening resilience, or the ability to respond to and absorb the effects of a hazardous event in a timely and efficient manner and to sustain this ability in the future, and adaptation; the process of adjusting to actual or expected climate change stimuli or their effects, should be at the forefront of planning.  Local governments have an important role to play through the provision of adequate infrastructure, regulation of land use, and other public services that are crucial for urban resilience. Mobilizing local governments, in collaboration with national governments, non-governmental organizations, and international organizations, among others, is also critical for an integrated multi-sectoral approach to climate change. 

The Course on Planning for Climate Change in African Cities provides the foundation for understanding cities  exposure and sensitivity to climate change, and how cities can manage these impacts in the face of growing uncertainty. It does so by introducing the basic concepts of urban resilience and adaptation, by using illustrative case studies in different African cities. Furthermore, this module provides lectures on the different approaches for climate change planning, whether ad hoc, strategic or mainstreaming; introduces the different steps in the planning cycle   from initial assessment to monitoring and evaluation; and presents the different decision support and assessment tools for prioritizing climate change actions. This course broadens the discussion on planning for climate change by engaging learners to apply their knowledge and practice their decision-making skills in a simulated exercise.

In line with development that minimizes the harm caused by climate change impacts, while maximizing the many human development opportunities presented by a more resilient future, we ask: what are the connections between urban risk and vulnerability? How is climate change and urban resilience conceptualized and applied in practice? Which policies and measures should be introduced to address climate change? Finally, how to choose among different measures that address climate change adaptation, urban resilience, and other development objectives? 

Course Objectives:
At the end of this course, learners should be able to:

 	Recognize the effects, impacts, and drivers of climate change in cities

"6",6,"Climate Change and Water in Mountains: A Global Concern","What is climate change ? How are mountain regions affected by the evolution of water resources and their uses ? What kind of risks need to be considered ? , Mountains are recognized as particularly sensitive physical environments where intense and rapid changes have in the past, and may increasingly in the future, place pressure on their resource base. 

In this context, a team of roughly 100 experts worked from 2008 to 2013 for the European ACQWA project (www.acqwa.ch) which was coordinated by the University of Geneva. The primary objectives of the project were to assess the impacts of a changing climate on the quantity and quality of water originating in mountain regions, particularly where snow- and ice melt represent a large, sometimes the largest, streamflow component. A further objective of the project was to determine the potential disruptions to water-dependent economic activities related to the climate impacts on hydrological systems, and to propose a portfolio of possible adaptation strategies.

This particular MOOC is inspired by the ACQWA Project and offers a better understanding of climate change, its impacts on the quality and quantity of water in mountain regions and the risks related to changing water resources. From an interdisciplinary perspective, the participation of twenty-five instructors from five different countries (Switzerland, England, South Korea, India and Nepal) and fourteen institutions (UNIGE, RTS, UNIFR, UZH, ETHZ, Meteodat GmbH, WGMS, Imperial College London, Agroscope, R publique et Canton de Gen ve, Yonsei University, IHCAP, ICIMOD, SDC, FOEN) highlights the diversity of both theoretical and practical viewpoints related to these issues.

By the end of this course, you will be able :

- to define the general concept of climate change in mountain regions
- to understand the concepts associated with climate change such as adaptation and water governance strategies
- to consider the impacts of climate change on water resources in mountain regions
- to identify the impacts of climate change on hydropower, agriculture, aquatic ecosystems and health 
- to enumerate risks that can occur in mountain areas and lead to disruptions in water availability and use.

Your acquired knowledge will be evaluated through multiple-choice quizzes at the end of each unit of the course.

This MOOC on  Climate Change and Water in Mountain Regions : A Global Concern  was initiated and financed by the University of Geneva, through its Institute for Environmental Sciences.

Africa is considered one to be one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change.   Historically, climate-related hazards such as drought, flooding, pest and disease outbreaks, coastal storms and heat waves have had devastating impacts on people and the environment in which they live. Often the damage knocks back progress that has been made in social and economic development, slowing down the achievement of development goals.  Climate models suggest that many of these climatic hazards will intensify as the global climate warms. Building resilience to climate risks, through adaptation, is critically important for future development in Africa., The course will examine adaptation in theory and in practice, through a focus on four sectors that are critically important for climate resilient development in Africa: Water Security, Agriculture and Food Security, Ecosystems and Ecosystem Services and Resilient Cities.",12,"course explores climate change adaptation important african context africa considered one one vulnerable regions climate change historically climate related hazards drought flooding pest disease outbreaks coastal storms heat waves devastating impacts people environment live often damage knocks back progress made social economic development slowing achievement development goals climate models suggest many climatic hazards intensify global climate warms building resilience climate risks adaptation critically important future development africa course examine adaptation theory practice focus four sectors critically important climate resilient development africa water security agriculture food security ecosystems ecosystem services resilient cities","cours explor climat chang adapt import african context africa consid one one vulner region climat chang histor climat relat hazard drought flood pest diseas outbreak coastal storm heat wave devast impact peopl environ live often damag knock back progress made social econom develop slow achiev develop goal climat model suggest mani climat hazard intensifi global climat warm build resili climat risk adapt critic import futur develop africa cours examin adapt theori practic focus four sector critic import climat resili develop africa water secur agricultur food secur ecosystem ecosystem servic resili citi",0,1,0,5,"reflex_adpt_keystems"

Adopted by 193 member states, the goals represent an important international step in setting humanity on a trajectory towards sustainable development. Within this course, you will get a historical overview of how sustainability has been understood, as well as a thorough introduction to the SDGs   what they are, how progress can be measured, and how the SDGs are relevant for the management of the global systems supporting humanity. The course will examine how various societal actors are responding to and implementing the SDGs. , While all of the SDGs are essential to sustainable development, SDG 13, Climate Action, is usually perceived as the most urgent in terms of the need for a swift implementation on a global scale. Therefore, particular focus is given to this SDG. Through the course, you will gain up-to-date knowledge of the current understanding of human impacts on the Earth at the planetary level.

This course,  Beyond the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): Addressing Sustainability and Development,  is the first course in the Sustainability and Development MasterTrack  Certificate, but you can also take this course as a stand-alone learning opportunity. , Sustainability and development pose unprecedented challenges as human societies grow and seek to ensure future wellbeing and prosperity. In this course, we ll focus on addressing the twin challenges of sustainability and development with actionable knowledge for innovating solutions to the world s most pressing problems like climate change, poverty and inequality, and biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation. Rather than sustainability being a qualifier for development (e.g. sustainable development), we conceptualize Sustainability and Development as co-equal fields of inquiry and action that seek to build bridges between the natural, social and applied sciences and the humanities. When sustainability and development are placed on an equal footing, it requires us to think more explicitly about the trade-offs, co-benefits and synergies between them, which we will be exploring in depth in each week.

Throughout the course, you will be introduced to the theoretical currents in Sustainability and Development, and will garner an in-depth understanding of the United Nations  17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We will also consider the methods and skills necessary for designing innovative solutions to sustainability and development problems through the emerging field of Sustainability Science.

In this course, we will explore three of the most pressing challenges undergirding the  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) including climate change, poverty and inequality, and ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss, with case studies to guide and challenge our thinking. In the final week of the course, we will discuss the trade-offs, co-benefits and synergies between these challenges, especially as they relate to designing innovative solutions for achieving  our sustainability and development goals.

By the end of this course, you will be able to:
1. Understand and explain the world s most pressing problems with a specific focus on poverty & inequality, ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss, and climate change.
2. Critically analyze the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and their relationship to the world s most pressing problems.
3. Use frameworks and evidence necessary to develop solutions.
4. Assess relevant solutions that would help realize the SDGs and at the same time solve the pressing problems.

This MOOC is at the junction between the development of Southern countries and sustainable development. 
It has: 
1) a macroeconomic and financial dimension, developed by Gael Giraud and Alain Grandjean; 
2) an ecological and climatic dimension, developed by David Claessen and ENS speakers; and 
3) a focus on Southern countries, developed by AFD speakers.

Here are the learning goals for the entire training program:

Goal 1: Be able to understand the relationship between the energy transition, the ecological transition, the role of energy in our economy, our economic development model, and financing issues. 
Goal 2: Know how to advocate for and lobby on issues and on the need to change reality in order to implement strategies and action plans.
Goal 3: Be able to make a link between the Energy transition and financing solutions, and between comprehension and action.  
No one questions the imperative need to ensure development based on personal well-being and a fair distribution of wealth.

The Challenges of a Transition for All  
Until now the development of Northern countries has been based on an increasing exploitation of energy resources and a greater freedom of trade and exchange at the global scale. We now know that such a model is no longer sustainable, due to global warming and to the overexploitation of resources, which lead to health, social, and environmental disasters.

The Role of Developing Countries
With that in mind, how can we ensure fair and equitable growth for all? What role do countries from the different regions in the South have to play in this complete upheaval of the current economic, trade, and political models in order to achieve an effective energy and ecological transition?
  
A MOOC to Respond to these Questions
This free online training offers complementary perspectives from several specialists of issues related to climate change and the development of Southern countries. They will share their very practical understanding of the current crises and the answers that can be provided. Participants will learn from studies by:
  Researchers from the prestigious  cole Normale Sup rieure in Paris
  Field experts from the Agence Fran aise de D veloppement, a funding agency that has been committed to helping developing countries for 75 years,
  Carbone 4 founder Alain Grandjean, who will share his experience, in particular on the economic and financial aspects.

"27",27,"Anti-Corruption in the context of the 2030 Agenda","The 2030 Agenda was a major breakthrough for the anti-corruption movement, as it emphasizes the importance of promoting transparency, accountability and anti-corruption for sustainable development, and makes an explicit link between corruption, peace and just and inclusive societies.
UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner said,  the 2030 Agenda has established anti-corruption as a global imperative on which hinges the achievement of all sustainable development goals. Goal 16 is rooted in human rights and highlights the importance of strengthening institutions and governance in our pledge to leave no one behind. We also have the opportunity to advance the anti-corruption agenda through the implementation of the UN Convention Against Corruption, which has now reached near-universal ratification, providing a comprehensive global framework to fight corruption in alignment with the 2030 Agenda. Corruption is a complex challenge that continues to persist in many countries across the world. It has a direct impact on the three dimensions of sustainable development   social, economic and environmental   and affects each of the five pillars of the 2030 agenda: people, planet, prosperity, peace and partnerships. 
Despite progress made, corruption is still a pressing challenge. Resources lost through corruption exceed the estimated 10 trillion dollars required to eradicate poverty by 2030. Money lost to corruption is essentially development denied to those most at risk of being left behind.

"29",29,"Introduction to the SEEA Central Framework","The System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA) 2012 Central Framework is a multipurpose conceptual framework for measuring the interactions between the environment and the economy. By providing an internationally agreed standard with agreed concepts, definitions and classifications, the SEEA is an invaluable tool for compiling integrated statistics on the economy and the environment. The SEEA framework follows a similar accounting structure to the System of National Accounts (SNA). The SEEA uses concepts, definitions and classifications consistent with the SNA in order to facilitate the integration of environmental and economic statistics. By doing so, the SEEA allows us to develop indicators and conduct analysis on the economy-environment nexus.
The SEEA facilitates better informed decision-making. The SEEA Central Framework offers a means of monitoring pressures exerted by the economy on the environment, in terms of abstraction of natural resources and emissions; impacts in terms of changes in stocks of natural resources; and how the economy responds in terms of expenditure on environmental protection and resource management. The SEEA does not propose particular indicators, but is instead a holistic multi-purpose information system that can generate a wide range of statistics and indicators with varying potential analytical applications.
The course is self-paced without instruction and can be taken at any point in time.
The course is available in Arabic, English, French, Russian and Spanish.

The complex and aspirational 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), require multidisciplinary methods for developing implementation strategies because of their  indivisible whole  nature. Furthermore, the 17 Sustainable Development Goals and their targets are closely interlinked and require innovative and unconventional policy approaches, such as those focusing on the intersections (meeting points), interlinkages and complex causal relationships. This e-Learning course deals with the aspects of  Why  and  How  of integration and ESCAP methodologies and tools to aid integrated and interlinked policy making process.
The course consists of three modules, which give insights on the importance of the integration of the three dimensions of sustainable development, and provide further guidance on available tools and their application for policy making and implementation.
The first module on Integration of the Three Dimensions of Sustainable Development is based on the UN ESCAP publication with correlating title   Integrating the three dimensions of sustainable development: A framework and tools. The module defines and articulates to policy makers the essence of integration of the three dimensions of sustainable developmentnamely economic, social and environmental, across the policy cycle.
The second module on Systems Thinking Framework to Support the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development and the SDGs provides an overview of systems thinking methodology and school of thought, a step-by-step guide to systems thinking modelling and examples of application in countries of the Asia-Pacific region. The module also briefly introduces the ESCAP experience in applying systems thinking to SDG integration analysis and provides examples and case studies from contributing partners.
The third module on ESCAP s Methodology for Applying Systems Thinking in Asia-Pacific Countries for Integrating SDG 6 into National Planning describes the practical application of the ESCAP analytical framework for integration of SDG 6 on Clean Water and Sanitation with the other 16 SDGs at the target level and builds on the Analytical Framework for Integration of Water and Sanitation SDGs and Targets Using Systems Thinking Approach. The module also describes the practical application of the methodology in pilot countries and lessons learned.

Among the priorities agreed upon by member states is social protection   cited in the agenda as a primary means to protect all individuals and families against social contingencies and market risks across the life-cycle. Countries are called on to  implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors, and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable. 
Currently, an estimated 69.4 per cent of the world s population lives without adequate social protection coverage, including lack of access to a pension, unemployment benefits, health insurance, and income guarantees.
According to the International Labour Organization, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has simultaneously,  exposed deep-seated inequalities and significant gaps in social protection coverage, comprehensiveness and adequacy across all countries  and,  provoked an unparalleled social protection policy response . It is therefore time to accelerate the transformation of social protection systems in light of the pandemic, to ensure human-centred recovery and resilience.
The ambitious objectives of the 2030 Agenda and the newfound drive for building comprehensive social protection systems will require concerted efforts from across the spectrum of UN and national actors, joining up disparate interventions and leveraging new tools to build enhanced social protection programmes and achieve the 2030 target.

"42",42,"SEEA Experimental Ecosystem Accounting","The SEEA EEA constitutes an integrated statistical framework for organizing biophysical data, measuring ecosystem services, tracking changes in ecosystem assets and linking this information to economic and other human activity. The SEEA EEA complements the SEEA Central Framework by taking a different perspective. The Central Framework looks at  individual environmental assets , such as water resources, energy resources, etc. and how those assets move between the environment and the economy. In contrast, the SEEA EEA takes the perspective of ecosystems and considers how individual environmental assets interact as part of natural processes within a given spatial area. Ecosystem accounting takes a spatial approach, often utilizing earth observation and geospatial data. Using this spatial approach, the SEEA EEA accounts for the extent and condition of ecosystems, the flow of services provided by ecosystems and the contributions and benefits of ecosystems to economic and other human activity.
This course provides an overview of the SEEA EEA, including how the SEEA EEA can be used for policy. The course covers ecosystem extent, condition and service accounts as well as accounting for biodiversity, water and carbon.
The course is self-paced without instruction and can be taken at any point in time.

It needs leaders who stand up for UN values  and who inspire through their commitment to peace, justice, respect, human rights, tolerance, and solidarity.

"52",52,"Cities and Marine Plastic Pollution: Building a Circular Economy","This free eLearning course was developed to support city-level capacity building on the topic of plastic waste management. The purpose of this course is to share the latest knowledge and approaches to measuring and managing plastic pollution from land-based sources, in particular cities, for the achievement of local, national and regional goals related to sustainable development.
ABSTRACT
Plastic pollution is entering our oceans at an alarming rate, damaging our marine environments and endangering local livelihoods. The Asia-Pacific is an important centre of innovation for plastic waste management and a hotspot for pollution. Across the region, cities and city governments are at the frontier of global efforts to stop plastic waste entering the environment. 
This course was developed for the Closing the Loop project by UN ESCAP in partnership with the Government of Japan. Closing the Loop aims to reduce the environmental impact of cities in ASEAN by addressing plastic waste pollution in the marine environment. In support of the ASEAN Framework of Action on Marine Debris and the G20 Osaka Blue Ocean Vision, the project will bring a more circular approach to plastic waste management and reduce the amount of waste entering the marine environment.
This course was developed to facilitate local government capacity building on the topic of marine plastic waste. Course development was led by UN ESCAP in collaboration with Ocean Conservancy, UN Environment Programme (UNEP), the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES), Women in Informal Employment: Globalizing and Organizing (WIEGO), Coordinating Body on the Seas of East Asia (COBSEA), Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), the International Solid Waste Association (ISWA), Plymouth Marine Lab, Wageningen University & Research, Keio University and the University of Leeds.

"54",54,"EQUIP","The failures of a free market approach to development has led to an increased demand for advice and support in crafting industrial policies that promote a movement into more sophisticated manufacturing activities with greater value addition. The shortage of adequately trained national analysts leads to an extensive dependency on international advisers and in the most alarming cases to unrealistic strategic objectives and the deployment of inappropriate policy tools. Every country should be equipped with simple analytical tools which can help them to answer imperative questions such as: How is our industrial sector performing relative to competitors? Where is there potential for expansion, upgrading, employment generation or enhanced energy efficiency in our industrial sector? How diversified and embedded is our industry? Answers to questions such as these are vital for successful strategy setting and industrial policy formulation. Global experience indicates that for the industrial policy process to be effective it has to be evidence-based, participatory and focused on realistic objectives. International best practice examples suggest that a successful industrial policy cycle must start from a thorough industrial diagnosis that maps the local and global industrial landscape and provides an in-depth understanding of country characteristics, constraints and opportunities as well as global trends. However, a key challenge for many developing country governments is a shortage of adequately trained national analysts and, thus, the lack of appropriate capacities to follow an industrial strategy formulation process that is sufficiently evidence-based.

"55",55,"Integrating Climate Risk Information into NAPs","At its 21st session, the UNFCCC Conference of Parties (COP-21) emphasized the importance of accelerated adaptation planning and implementation. As of August 2017, 152 Parties to the Convention out of 197 have submitted their first Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to the UNFCCC, with 102 including an adaptation component, the majority being developing countries. The UNFCCC report released in October 2016 on progress in the process of formulating and implementing National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) indicates that many more countries, including over 80% of Least Developed Countries (LDCs), have embarked on developing a NAP.
The development and implementation of NAPs involve decisions related to climate risk management, which require reliable, relevant, usable and timely climate information.
Climate information used within the NAP process encompasses a wide range of information on past, present and future climate, and products which help improve the understanding of climate and its impacts on natural and human systems and support decisions to improve climate-related outcomes. Climate services involve the production, translation, transfer and use of climate knowledge and information for this purpose. Climate services, therefore, play a crucial role in the planning, financing and implementation of adaptation to climate change.
In this context and drawing on the WMO-led Global Framework for Climate Services (GFCS), WMO and UNITAR developed capacity building e-learning materials in support of a wider training package on  Integration Climate Risk Information into National Adaptation Planning . The aim of this e-learning component is to contribute to capacity building that will bridge the information and communication gaps currently affecting the demand for climate information services and their supply.

The course is designed to respond the learning needs of both climate services providers (National Hydro-meteorological Services, research/academic and international organizations), and users (e.g. decision makers, private investors, non-governmental organizations, etc.), as well as of those working at the science-policy interface for outreach or communication purposes.
The training is modular  and provides you with the liberty to  choose and combine different thematic modules. There are two main themes or learning tracks available as illustrated in the figure below.
Learning track 1 (green-colored): Producing climate information for NAPs
Learning track 2 (yellow-colored): Using climate information for NAPs
Both learning tracks have in common the Intro and Wrap-up modules.
How to choose the learning track that best suits your profile and learning needs?
Once you complete the Intro module, you are recommended to undertake a test. Based on your answers to the five questions of the test you will be advised to follow either learning track 1 or 2, or both.
Each learning track culminates with a quiz that will assess the knowledge you will acquire. If you pass the quiz with a minimum mark of 70%, a certificate of completion will be issued to you. If you choose to follow both learning tracks you can receive two certificates by passing both quizzes.

"57",57,"Financing in Health","Results Based Financing (RBF) for Health is an interactive course that includes narrated presentations, discussion forums, group work and a quiz for each module to assess your knowledge.
The course is based on materials developed over the course of several years for the delivery of face-to-face RBF learning events, which generated a rich repository of knowledge. That knowledge has been translated into e-learning modules to reach a critical mass of health practitioners globally. The course aims to equip  with specific knowledge to help determine whether RBF is an appropriate tool for their context and if so, what type of RBF approach may be appropriate to adopt.
The e-learning course is supported by funding from the Health Results Innovation Trust Fund (HRITF). Since 2007, HRITF has been pioneering RBF programs, with a particular focus on improving maternal and child health outcomes to accelerate progress towards Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 1c, 4 and 5. Learn more: www.rbfhealth.org or www.facebook.com/RBFhealth and www.twitter.com/RBFhealth.
Please take a moment to listen to the course introduction by Petra Vergeer, who is one of the main coordinators of this e-learning course and who helped develop and taught the material in this course in its face-to-face version.
Course context
Traditionally, government and donor funds to improve health service delivery have concentrated on increasing critical inputs, such as infrastructure, equipment, supplies, drugs and vaccines. Since the adoption of the Millennium Declaration in 2000, this development assistance for health has more than doubled. And yet the increase in investments has not translated into the expected health outcomes in low and middle income countries. The challenge these countries face is unequal access and utilization of essential health services, often due to low quality of services, inefficient delivery of services and limited management capacity. In addition, poor households in many countries face impoverishment due to limited financial protection in the health system. Consequently, many countries, especially those in Africa, risk not achieving the MDGs for maternal and child health by 2015.
As a result, many governments and development agencies have been motivated to try new innovations and approaches that can boost health system functioning. RBF is one approach that is gaining momentum with country governments and development partners. RBF links financing to pre-determined results such as the actual use of health services, as well as their quality, and as opposed to financing inputs such as medical equipment or supplies. The experience so far shows promising results, especially in terms of increased utilization of key maternal and child health services. In addition, RBF is seen as a way to strengthen core health systems, making them more accountable and efficient by delivering greater value for money.
A vital aspect for any successful RBF approach is ensuring the appropriateness of the strategy for a particular context, which is at the core of this e-learning course. The World Bank Group and its partners has undertaken many capacity building engagements on RBF, including:
Consultations with key stakeholders.
Study tours from countries considering or starting RBF to those already implementing them.
Knowledge and lessons-sharing events.
Technical training workshops for policy makers and other stakeholders.
Peer-to-peer exchange forums.
These programs are geared at informed decision-making on the appropriateness of RBF and building implementation capacity to mitigate the risk of failure in implementing RBF mechanisms. This e-learning platform is designed to complement these initiatives, and to: equip  with the tools to decide whether RBF may be an appropriate policy option to consider in addressing health system challenges; and to be able to apply RBF design and implementation concepts/principles.
The objectives of the course are to:
Provide background knowledge on RBF and its different approaches.
Introduce core principles of RBF for health.
Provide some country examples of RBF for health in practice.

"66",66,"Unleashing the Power of the Private Sector for the 2030 Agenda - 2021","Registrations open from 10 February to 10 April
The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is unprecedented in its scope and ambition. The UN and governments have neither the reach nor the resources to implement it alone. Engagement, especially with the private sector, is imperative for the 2030 Agenda to succeed.
The private sector with its unparalleled reach has the capacity to be a key driver to achieve the objectives of the 2030 Agenda and in some cases is already performing this role. The UN and its member states must seize the opportunity to form strategic partnerships with private sector entities and advocate for businesses to embrace sustainable development in order to achieve the 2030 Agenda.
Moreover, the 2030 Agenda offers the private sector numerous opportunities to access new markets and institutional investment, estimated at about $12 trillion by 2030 while adding 380 million new jobs. This in itself is a compelling argument for the private sector and governments to work together to make the 2030 Agenda a reality.

"72",72,"Air Quality Management","Air pollution has become a major challenge to global health with the latest estimates from the Global Burden of Disease project suggesting that in 2015, nearly six and one-half million people died prematurely either from air pollution in their outdoor environment or from air pollution associated with the use of solid biofuels for cooking and heating in homes. Unfortunately, most of these deaths are now occurring in the developing world. The World Bank is moving to address this major public health challenge through its Environmental Health and Pollution Management business line with the launch of the Pollution Management and Environmental Health (PMEH) multi-donor trust fund, through pilot programs to demonstrate how to improve air quality in specific cities, through research to improve our understanding of where air pollution is most prevalent and through learning products such as this online e-learning course.
This Air Quality Management series of courses has been created for development professionals, government officials, and other partners who want to learn about the fundamentals of air quality management planning. Successful air quality management programs can reduce emissions that lead to air pollution while simultaneously providing other development benefits that accrue locally as well as globally. Benefits can include improved public health, energy savings, economic development, agricultural benefits, and reduced emissions of greenhouse gases and other short-lived climate pollution. We hope this introductory course provides the foundation for establishing such a program in your community and that follow-up courses will provide skills and information on how to monitor air pollution and increase public awareness, how to develop emission inventories and track progress, how to assess the benefits of air quality improvement, how to select control strategies that are most effective and finally these courses will share information on the importance of stakeholder engagement and describe regulatory approaches that have been most effective elsewhere.
Designing and implementing an effective Air Quality Management (AQM) program relies on a complete understanding of the specific issues affecting a given region, requiring awareness raising, data collection and capacity building. This course provides a basic introduction to concepts of air pollution and its management.

The course is based on the UN publication  Managing Infrastructure Assets for Sustainable Development: A Handbook for Local and National Governments    the result of a joint collaboration of UN DESA, UNCDF and UNOPS.
The Handbook includes inputs from renowned experts from regional development banks, local government associations, relevant UN system entities as well as think tanks and academia. The Handbook provides local and national governments with a set of practical tools to improve infrastructure asset management as well as guidance on how to adapt these tools to the socio-economic and environmental challenges of our time.
It addresses a set of key questions:
What assets do people need?
How can these assets be made to last the longest and perform the best?
How can their potential to save or generate revenue be maximized so as to unlock financial resources for other community needs, now and in the future?
In the answers to these questions lies the key to ensuring the reliability of public infrastructure and services at all levels.
This e-learning course aims to equip policymakers and government officials to find the answers in their specific national and local contexts.  It makes a compelling case that ultimately, asset management is a way to align strategic planning with infrastructure and service delivery in the real world. It will equip the learner with a rich set of tools to promote sound, forward-looking asset management that enhances the resilience, sustainability, reliability, and financial viability of infrastructure investments for present and future generations.
The course is divided into two parts: Fundamentals: Infrastructure Asset Management for Sustainable Development (Module 1-4) and InFocus: Infrastructure Asset Management for Sustainable Development (Module 5-8).

How can transboundary water cooperation play a role in leading to peace?, is pivotal for , FRESHWATER SECURITY, as a, TOP PRIORITY, in , TRANSBOUNDARY WATER MANAGEMENT, to address , WATER SECURITY CHALLENGES, Freshwater scarcity, stress, and crisis are increasing worldwide. More than a billion people live in water-scarce regions, and 3.5 billion could experience water scarcity by 2025. These pressures disproportionally affect vulnerable and marginalized people, including those living in poverty and displacement. Rising pollution levels accelerate the crisis by reducing water availability for human use and impacting aquatic life in rivers, lakes, aquifers, and the oceans., Transboundary basins account for roughly 60% of freshwater resources, serving 2.8 billion people, or 42% of the world s population. Complex shared transboundary freshwater and ecosystems cut across myriad sectoral needs, themes, and political boundaries. Setting effective policy goals, coupled with investments, means working at multiple scales with a range of public and private stakeholders throughout the watershed, from source to sea and beyond., This course presents multiple facets of governance for transboundary freshwater security   from financing mechanisms to negotiation skills   while emphasizing the urgency of sustainable development and cooperation at many levels. It extends from basic building blocks and concepts to advanced thinking about transboundary governance, and applies theory to practice through examples and case studies. Topics covered in six modules range from the fundamentals of transboundary water security to international water law, water diplomacy, negotiations, institutions, management tools, and sustainable finance., The course is designed for professionals who manage and make decisions about transboundary waters within line ministries and river basin organizations; managers of transboundary water projects and the Global Environment Facility (GEF) International Waters Portfolio; the GEF IW:LEARN Network; NGOs, academics, and private sector actors working on basin management; development practitioners; young professionals and future leaders in transboundary waters, including undergraduate and graduate students; and anyone else who is keen to learn about the topic., This MOOC was produced by the Global Water Partnership in collaboration with GEF IW:LEARN and its partners.

The SDGs are interconnected, recognizing that poverty cannot be eradicated without improved health and education, sustainable economic growth cannot occur on a planet under threat of climate change, and so forth., Goal 1,  End poverty in all its forms everywhere,  calls on stakeholders at every level to drastically reduce the number of people living in poverty, provide services and assistance to those in need, and ensure the resilience of the poor and vulnerable in times of crisis. SDG 1 builds on earlier calls to cut poverty in lower-income countries by, first, calling for the elimination of extreme poverty worldwide by 2030, and for every country to cut all dimensions of nationally-defined poverty by half by the same date. Goal 1 further draws linkages between poverty and climate disasters, and sets targets for social protection, resource mobilization and policy development. Likewise, Goal 10,  Reduce inequality within and among countries,  calls on stakeholders at all levels to empower the economic, political, and social inclusion of all people; and for governments to work together to provide pathways of opportunity across the world., This course will present an overview of the definitions, scale, and scope of different forms of poverty and inequality across the world. It will examine links between poverty, inequality, and well-being; opportunities for socioeconomic mobility; the particular challenges facing women, minorities, Indigenous people, and vulnerable populations; and how poverty and inequality link to issues like climate change, migration, and conflict. Finally, the course will conclude with a look at policy approaches and tools for addressing poverty and inequality in a variety of contexts.,   Understanding Poverty and Inequality was created by the SDG Academy in partnership with the Center for Sustainable Development at the Brookings Institution.,  Module 1: An Introduction to Poverty and Inequality,  Module 2: Multidimensional Measures of Poverty,  Module 3: Explaining Global Inequality,  Module 4:Poverty and Subjective Well-being,  Module 5: Identity and Exclusion,  Module 6: Poverty and Inequality, Today and Tomorrow",88,"mean poverty inequality take achieve sdg 1 poverty sdg 10 reduced inequalities 2030 mean poverty inequality take achieve sdg 1 poverty sdg 10 reduced inequalities 2030 causes poverty inequality remaining challenges poverty reduction around world help ensure one left behind september 2015 193 member states united nations adopted 2030 agenda sustainable development committed 17 sustainable development goals sdgs sdgs interconnected recognizing poverty eradicated without improved health education sustainable economic growth occur planet threat climate change forth goal 1 end poverty forms everywhere calls stakeholders every level drastically reduce number people living poverty provide services assistance need ensure resilience poor vulnerable times crisis sdg 1 builds earlier calls cut poverty lower income countries first calling elimination extreme poverty worldwide 2030 every country cut dimensions nationally defined poverty half date goal 1 draws linkages poverty climate disasters sets targets social protection resource mobilization policy development likewise goal 10 reduce inequality within among countries calls stakeholders levels empower economic political social inclusion people governments work together provide pathways opportunity across world course present overview definitions scale scope different forms poverty inequality across world examine links poverty inequality well opportunities socioeconomic mobility particular challenges facing women minorities indigenous people vulnerable populations poverty inequality link issues like climate change migration conflict finally course conclude look policy approaches tools addressing poverty inequality variety contexts understanding poverty inequality created sdg academy partnership center sustainable development brookings institution module 1 introduction poverty inequality module 2 multidimensional measures poverty module 3 explaining global inequality module 4 poverty subjective well module 5 identity exclusion module 6 poverty inequality today tomorrow","mean poverti inequ take achiev sdg 1 poverti sdg 10 reduc inequ 2030 mean poverti inequ take achiev sdg 1 poverti sdg 10 reduc inequ 2030 caus poverti inequ remain challeng poverti reduct around world help ensur one left behind septemb 2015 193 member state unit nation adopt 2030 agenda sustain develop commit 17 sustain develop goal sdgs sdgs interconnect recogn poverti erad without improv health educ sustain econom growth occur planet threat climat chang forth goal 1 end poverti form everywher call stakehold everi level drastic reduc number peopl live poverti provid servic assist need ensur resili poor vulner time crisi sdg 1 build earlier call cut poverti lower incom countri first call elimin extrem poverti worldwid 2030 everi countri cut dimens nation defin poverti half date goal 1 draw linkag poverti climat disast set target social protect resourc mobil polici develop likewis goal 10 reduc inequ within among countri call stakehold level empow econom polit social inclus peopl govern work togeth provid pathway opportun across world cours present overview definit scale scope differ form poverti inequ across world examin link poverti inequ well opportun socioeconom mobil particular challeng face women minor indigen peopl vulner popul poverti inequ link issu like climat chang migrat conflict final cours conclud look polici approach tool address poverti inequ varieti context understand poverti inequ creat sdg academi partnership center sustain develop brook institut modul 1 introduct poverti inequ modul 2 multidimension measur poverti modul 3 explain global inequ modul 4 poverti subject well modul 5 ident exclus modul 6 poverti inequ today tomorrow",11,5,9,1,"participation_keystems"

    , 
    The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted by UN Member States in 2015 affirms that  the spread of information and communication technology and global interconnectedness has great potential to accelerate human progress, to bridge the digital divide and to develop knowledge societies.  Women s empowerment through E-Government can, indeed, accelerate the achievement of Goals and Targets across the 2030 Agenda. The new EGovforWomen Online Toolkit directly contributes to Sustainable Development Goals 5, 9, 10 and 16.

This online platform is an innovative public resource related to the design and implementation of gender-responsive E-government institutional ecosystems in the Asia-Pacific region. The toolkit represents the first region-wide toolbox to support the gender-mainstreaming of E-Government.  Through a set of 5 comprehensive modules, it provides key pointers for policymakers on gender-responsive design of e-service delivery, e-participation and connectivity initiatives, and introduces a capabilities-based approach to outcome evaluation of e-government for women s empowerment.

Gender, governance and e-government
	Gender-responsive e-service delivery
	Gender-responsive e-participation
	Gender-responsive connectivity architecture
	Assessing gender-responsiveness of e-government ecosystems
Each module is oriented towards a clearly identified target group, and is geared towards the attainment of specific learning outcomes. Therefore, all modules have clearly delineated sub-units to enable step-by-step learning and exercises/ assignments to test knowledge attainments (including a case study, food for thought, group assignments and quizzes). Content of the modules is drawn from the regional research on e-government for women s empowerment in Asia and the Pacific conducted by UNESCAP and IT for Change in 2015-16; as well as a scan of open source documentation of good practices in gender and e-government in the region, and in other contexts.

In the implementation of this project, ESCAP has partnered with IT for Change, India (www.ITforChange.net). IT for Change is a not-for-profit organisation that seeks to build a socially just and gender-equitable information society for the global South. Towards this, it is engaged in policy research, advocacy and field practice in the domains of gender, digital technologies and development; ICTs in education; e-government; Internet governance, digital rights; and data for development. At IT for Change, this project was led by Anita Gurumurthy, Executive Director with support from Nandini Chami, Senior Research Associate.

This project has been made possible with the generous funding from the Government of the Republic of Korea, through the Korea-ESCAP Cooperation Fund (KECF).

About us

The Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) serves as the United Nations  regional hub promoting cooperation among countries to achieve inclusive and sustainable development. The largest regional intergovernmental platform with 53 member States and 9 associate members, ESCAP has emerged as a strong regional think-tank offering countries sound analytical products that shed insight into the evolving economic, social and environmental dynamics of the region. The Commission s strategic focus is to deliver on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which it does by reinforcing and deepening regional cooperation and integration to advance connectivity, financial cooperation and market integration. ESCAP s research and analysis coupled with its policy advisory services, capacity building and technical assistance to governments aims to support countries  sustainable and inclusive development ambitions.

The objective of the self-paced e-learning course is to strengthen the capacity of National Stakeholders to design, adapt and implement integrated and coherent plans and policies and improved decision making among national stakeholders (policy makers, senior planners, civil society, academics and private sector) involved in recovery planning (i.e., Covid-19) and rebuilding towards SDGs implementation. , With its recovery focus and attention to advancing systems thinking and co-creation skills among national stakeholders, this e-learning course on  Integrated Recovery Planning and Policy Coherence Towards the SDGs  serves as timely compliment to the growing suite of e-learning courses on integrated approaches across the UN system, such as the UN Sustainable Development Group s  Primer on the SDGs  hosted by the UN Staff System College, and its e-course on  Integrated Approaches to Mainstreaming, Acceleration and Policy Support for the SDGs  hosted by UNICEF/UNDP. , The e-learning course builds on UNDESA and UNITAR's partnership throughout 2019 by jointly organizing regional workshops where many participating countries shared case studies and discussed challenges encountered in the formulation and implementation of integrated and coherent policy plans. It also builds on the implementation of UNDESA Development Account project  Implementation of national sustainable development strategies in selected countries in Africa and Latin America  that was implemented in three (3) representative countries in Costa Rica, Egypt and Ethiopia between 2016-2020., The overall objective of this project is to strengthen the capacity of Member States to design, adapt and implement Integrated and coherent policy plans and improved decision making among national stakeholders (policy makers, senior planners, civil society counterparts and academics) involved in COVID-19 recovery planning, rebuilding and SDGs implementation., Following the completion of the course,  will be able to, Define key building blocks of an integrated recovery planning and policy coherence exercise towards transformational change in the SDGs, with particular emphasis on building back better in the wake of shocks such as the Covid-19 pandemic; , Map, analyze and engage effectively with key stakeholders in the national priority-setting process;  , Apply elements of systems thinking to assess and map intersectoral interactions, and identify nationally relevant ""leverage points"" (or ""accelerators"");  , Apply back-casting and scenario planning approaches to identify strategic policy options for achieving recovery objectives and for identifying robust policies and adaptive actions to ensure resilience to shocks;  , Provide examples of tools and methods used for integrated planning and policy coherence;  , Conduct institutional readiness assessment on institutional policy coherence against SDG requirements.  , The course consists of five modules:, Module 1. Introduction to Integrated Recovery Planning and Policy Coherence towards SDGs, Module 2. Mobilizing Stakeholders to Envision Success, Module 3. Systems Thinking to Understand Connections and Leverage Points, Module 4. Back-casting and Scenario Analysis to Identify Strategic Policy Options and Transformative Policy Pathways, Module 5. Coherent and Adaptive Implementation of Transformative Policy Pathways, This self-paced e-learning course is developed in English and consists of five modules. Each module is developed around the overall learning objectives, as well as second-level learning objectives specific to each module. The modules are supported by an objective multiple-choice quiz (summative assessment) that is conducted prior to taking the lesson (ex-ante) and after taking the lesson (ex-post). The former will not be graded and serves only to provide a baseline of the learner s knowledge prior to taking the lesson. Net estimated study time for all modules is between 10-12 hours including all theory and assessments., The course is open to everyone.

"148",148,"Questionnaire development and testing","Statistics Norway is pleased to present a set of video lectures on Questionnaire development and testing. It is the first time Statistics Norway har transferred a course of this size to video. The aim is to make the experiences and theory from the face to face training we do internally and externally available to anyone, anywhere.
The lectures provide theoretical background mixed with examples from Norway and from work with other countries and organisations. Our aim is to contribute to improved questionnaires, leading to official statistics that is relevant and of best possible quality. The course is focussing on interviews with individuals and households, but most of the theory is the same for surveys covering businesses and other organisations.
The following topics are covered:
 1 Key concepts
This module contains an introduction to central concepts used in the rest of the course.
2 Specification
The specification module covers defining the central concepts to be investigated in the questionnaire, identifying the clients  information needs and investigating respondents  information availability.
3 Operationalisation
Operationalisation is to turn the topic we want to investigate into well-functioning questions and answers. The first lecture begins with key considerations and moves on to response options. The second lecture looks at questions, instructions and functionality.
4 Design
The design module covers why question order matter and how to develop optimal order, advice for visual design and use of instructions.
5 Testing
The course introduces four methods of testing questionnaires: Expert appraisals, cognitive interviews, behaviour coding and focus groups.
 
The lectures are found at an open Vimeo page. They have been used to undertake workshops mixing video with hands-on work on assignments, both face to face and through webinars. Work is being done to integrate the videos in a more comprehensive online course with assignments. References to materials in the lectures apply only for this version, which will also be free for all and available through this portal.

"149",149,"Constructing Producer Price Indexes and Import and Export Price Indexes","The Producer Price Index (PPI) is a family of indexes that measures the average change over time in the selling prices received by domestic producers of goods and services. PPIs measure price change from the perspective of the seller. This contrasts with other measures, such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) which measures price change from the purchaser s perspective. Sellers  and purchasers  prices may differ due to government subsides, sales and excise taxes, and distribution costs.
Producer Price Index data are widely used by the business community as well as government. Three major uses are:
As an economic indicator. The PPIs capture price movements prior to the retail level. Therefore, they may foreshadow subsequent price changes for businesses and consumers. National leaders and central banks employ these data in formulating fiscal and monetary policies.
As a deflator of other economic series. PPIs are used to adjust other economic time series for price changes and to translate those series into inflation-free currency values. For example, constant-dollar gross domestic product data are estimated using deflators based on PPI data.
As the basis for contract escalation. PPI data are commonly used in escalating purchase and sales contracts. These contracts typically specify cost amounts to be paid at some point in the future. It is often desirable to include an escalation clause that accounts for increases in input prices. (See BLS Report 807, Escalation and Producer Price Indexes: A Guide for Contracting Parties.)
Import and Export Price Indexes (MXP) are a family of indexes that measure the average change over time in the prices of nonmilitary goods and services traded between the domestic country and the rest of the world. The MXPs help to answer the question  how will trade affect the production of goods and services in the economy?  and are primarily used to deflate various foreign trade statistics.
Participants are encouraged to bring with them the following materials for use in discussions and workshops: 1) methodological documentation on how data related to the seminar topic are collected in their home countries; 2) questionnaires used in their countries for obtaining those data; and 3) sample publications of those data.
The seminar includes discussions on the following topics:
Producer Price Indexes (PPI) and Import and Export Price Indexes (MXP)
Conceptual framework
Target population
Sampling and weighting techniques
Selection of sample items and establishments
Development of specifications
Collection and processing of data

"150",150,"Environmental SDG Indicators","This e-learning course is a self-paced course with individual 10 modules developed by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the United Nations Statistical Institute for Asia and the Pacific (UNSIAP) and the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR). In September 2015, the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit adopted an international framework to guide development efforts, entitled  Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development . The Agenda is built around 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), divided into 169 targets, which are informed by 244 Indicators[1]. The importance of improving the availability of and access to data and statistics related to the environment was recognized through the adoption of a wide range of environmental SDG targets and indicators.
This course provides an overview of the importance of monitoring the environmental dimension of development, the linkage with existing statistical frameworks (FDES and SEEA) and how to use environment statistics in decision making. The modules will also provide a brief overview on all 25 SDG indicators under UNEP custodianship.

									, This e-learning course is a self-paced course with individual 10 modules developed by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the United Nations Statistical Institute for Asia and the Pacific (UNSIAP) and the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR). In September 2015, the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit adopted an international framework to guide development efforts, entitled  Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development . The Agenda is built around 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), divided into 169 targets, which are informed by 244 Indicators[1]. The importance of improving the availability of and access to data and statistics related to the environment was recognized through the adoption of a wide range of environmental SDG targets and indicators., This course provides an overview of the importance of monitoring the environmental dimension of development, the linkage with existing statistical frameworks (FDES and SEEA) and how to use environment statistics in decision making. The modules will also provide a brief overview on all 25 SDG indicators under UNEP custodianship., In particular, this e-learning course aims to build the capacity of countries   representatives of National Statistical Office (NSOs), Ministries of Environment and other stakeholders   to compile and use data on the environment-related SDGs for evidence-based decision-making and to promote cross-cutting data analysis to better understand the environmental dimension of development., Course structure:, Each module can be regarded as a stand-alone module and taken individually.

"154",154,"National metadata for SDGs","The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, sets forth the global vision to 2030. At its heart are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which provide the benchmarks that should be achieved by 2030 in order to leave no one behind. A robust follow-up and review mechanism for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda requires a solid framework of indicators and statistical data to monitor progress, inform policy and ensure accountability of all stakeholders at the global and national level. The global indicator framework consisting of 169 targets and 242 indicators was adopted by the General Assembly in 2017.
At the national level, the 2030 Agenda encourages member states to conduct regular and inclusive reviews of progress at the national and sub-national levels which are country-led and country-driven. The United Nations Statistics Division is working closely with national actors as well as international partners to build capacity in countries for reporting on the SDG indicators using national indicator frameworks.
National metadata are an important element in better understanding how the SDG indicator has been collected, processed and disseminated. The global metadata set can be used as guidance, but source and processing information will be different in each country and for each data source. Definitions and concepts may also vary and it is important to sensitise the user to this.
This is an e-learning course in how to compile national metadata for the SDGs. After introducing the SDGs overall and key metadata concepts, it provides guidance in how to fill a metadata template for SDG indicators. The e-learning course is based on trainings which have been conducted as part of the UNSD-DFID project on SDG monitoring.
The course is self-paced without instruction and can be taken at any point in time.

"157",157,"Economic Indicators","Timely and sound economic data are of critical importance to policymakers, the business community, consumers, and investors. Economic information helps a wide array of people assess how well an economy is performing and guides decision-making. What are economic indicators? What is their significance? How should they be interpreted? This seminar is an introduction to key economic indicators and how they are used. In depth discussion on how to construct the various indicators is not provided in this seminar.
The following BLS economic indicators and topics will be presented in this seminar:
Employment and Unemployment
Data on employed persons and the unemployment rate provide a vital snapshot of the strength of a labor market. A range of measures of labor underutilization and other employment data produced by BLS will also be discussed.
Wages and Labor Costs
Wages, earnings, and benefits account for a substantial part of a country s national income and are closely linked to the economic cycle. Determining levels and trends of pay rates by occupation, industry, locality, and region is important in the analysis of current economic developments. The seminar will also discuss indexes that measure the change over time in labor costs (Employment Cost Index) and data measuring the level of average costs per hour worked (Employer Costs for Employee Compensation).
Prices
Price indexes, indicators of the rates of inflation in a country s economy, also serve as a tool for adjusting wages, salaries, and other income payments to keep in step with rising prices. The seminar will address the importance of Consumer Price Indexes, Producer Price Indexes, and Import and Export Price Indexes.
Productivity and Unit Labor Costs
Productivity is one of the major determinants of the standard of living, since increases in productivity can result in higher real income and increased price stability. Measures of productivity and unit labor costs are important signals of international competitiveness.
 
Data discussed in this seminar are used to report on the following SDG indicators:
Indicator 5.4.1: Proportion of time spent on unpaid domestic and care work, by sex, age and location
Indicator 8.2.1: Annual growth rate of real GDP per employed person
Indicator 8.5.1: Average hourly earnings of female and male employees, by occupation, age and persons with disabilities
Indicator 8.5.2: Unemployment rate, by sex, age and persons with disabilities
Indicator 8.6.1: Proportion of youth (aged 15 24 years) not in education, employment or training
Indicator 9.2.2: Manufacturing employment as a proportion of total employment

"178",178,"Labor Market Information: Business Establishment Surveys","Labor market information is essential for tracking and analyzing the economy of a country. National and local governments need labor market information to reduce unemployment, generate employment, and plan training programs to meet the needs of industry. It is also used in determining future workforce training needs, identifying the availability of labor, ascertaining prevailing wage rates, and exploring potential markets. Labor market information is valuable to local and regional planning agencies as well as industries and businesses looking for site locations, seeking ways of attracting and retaining skilled workers, or assessing the scope and size of potential markets. Labor unions find this information useful for determining comparable wage and compensation levels, local working conditions, and training needs. Investors, educators, workers, and job seekers also benefit from timely and reliable labor market information to help them make sound decisions.
This seminar will show  how to develop labor market information using data collected from business establishments. A business establishment survey provides detailed data on employment, hours, and earnings of workers on payrolls. Establishment surveys can provide detailed data by industry and occupation, which are vital to understanding the dispersion of jobs in a country s economy.
Participants are encouraged to bring with them the following materials for use in discussions and workshops: 1) methodological documentation on how data related to the seminar topic are collected in their home countries; 2) questionnaires used in their countries for obtaining those data; and 3) sample publications of those data.

"180",180,"Civil Registration and Vital Statistics Systems","Civil registration (CR) is the recording of vital events in a person s life (e.g., birth, death) and is a fundamental function of the national government. Birth registration establishes an individual s legal identity at birth. Having a legal identity, name, nationality, proof of age, and the related are important human rights and enables individuals to exercise their rights (e.g., to vote) and enjoy various government, social, and private services. Vital statistics (VS) are statistics on these vital events and of the persons concerned. The availability of reliable and up-to-date VS depends on the level of development of CR. Having an effective CRVS system is critical for planning and monitoring programs across several sectors. Yet, over 110 low- and middle-income countries have deficient CRVS systems. This course provides practical tools and approaches to achieving 21st century state-of-the-art CRVS systems that are linked to identity management systems and tailored to local contexts. This self-paced format is offered for busy professionals who are able to take the course at their own pace and finish at any time. Learners will receive a Basic Level Certificate after successfully completing Core Modules 1-3 and can subsequently enroll in the Facilitated format to receive an Advanced Level Certificate.

"196",196,"Labor Market Information: Household Labor Force Surveys","Labor market information is essential for tracking and analyzing the economy of a country. National and local governments need labor market information to reduce unemployment, generate employment, and plan training programs to meet the needs of industry. It is also used in determining future workforce training needs, identifying the availability of labor, ascertaining prevailing wage rates, and exploring potential markets. Labor market information is valuable to local and regional planning agencies as well as industries and businesses looking for site locations, seeking ways of attracting and retaining skilled workers, or assessing the scope and size of potential markets. Labor unions find this information useful for determining comparable wage and compensation levels, local working conditions, and training needs. Investors, educators, workers, and job seekers also benefit from timely and reliable labor market information to help them make sound decisions.
This seminar will show  how to develop labor market information using data collected from households.  Household  data pertain to individuals and relate to where they reside. Household labor force surveys allow for the collection of comprehensive demographic data on the labor force such as age, sex, race, family relationship, marital status, occupation, and industry attachment. Household labor force surveys can also provide important information about members of the population who are not in the labor force.
Participants are encouraged to bring with them the following materials for use in discussions and workshops: 1) methodological documentation on how data related to the seminar topic are collected in their home countries; 2) questionnaires used in their countries for obtaining those data; and 3) sample publications of those data.
The seminar includes discussions on the following topics:
Introduction to labor markets
What they are and how they are defined
Reasons for conducting labor force surveys
Understanding components of the population
Who is in the labor force? Who is not in the labor force?
Employment status: Who is employed? Who is unemployed?

"197",197,"Statistical methods for correcting selection bias","About
Just as questionnaires are the means for observing reality through surveys, electronic platforms have the same role for big data. Most of the big data sources offer a non-probabilistic sample of the population of study, where several errors are induced by self-selection of individuals present on the sample, targeting decisions from the owners of the electronic platform and limitations of the coverage of said platform.
In this course you will learn about the principal techniques for correcting bias through a statistical approach. This work is based on previous research work from Data-Pop Alliance on correcting bias on mobile network data and a fundamental book published by Eurostat.
Subject matter
The use of Big Data is accelerating within the development and humanitarian practice. If used right, its implementation can foster inclusion, efficiency, and lower project costs which may benefit public and private organizations involved on development programs. Therefore, our technical courses cover different aspects on data science and data engineering relevant for the context of official statistics and sustainable development.
Methodology
All the programing material is provided in Python using the conventional Open Source libraries for Data Science.  Most of the sessions are interactive and on a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb). A practical exercise is completed at the end of each session.
Format and instructors
This course is offered face-to-face (or via videoconference if necessary), it has a duration of 18 hours ideally distributed along 3 days, and is designed for 20 . Each course is delivered by a team of 2 training specialists.
Requirements
Some programming experience is required; Python is preferable though not necessary.
Syllabus
A. Main challenges of big data as an statistical source
We define a statistical approach to big data and highlight the main challenges and opportunities it presents when trying to use it as a statistical source. We go through the specific difficulties of different big data sources of interest such as mobile network data, bank transactional data and social media among others.
B. Unit-level methods for correcting bias
Correcting selection bias in big data can be analogue to procedures used in other data sources which have the same problem of non-random selection and had been studied for a while: web or telephone opt-in surveys.
We will go through different techniques for correcting selectivity bias at the unit of observation level, which most often will be individuals. Even if methods are analogue to those used in opt-in surveys, what you will learn in this course is how to use those procedures in massive data, by leveraging big data frameworks such as Spark, through its easy-to-use Python API: PySpark.
C. Domain-level methods for correcting bias
Correcting selection bias in big data can be analogue to procedures used in other data sources which have the same problem of non-random selection and had been studied for a while: web or telephone opt-in surveys.
We will go through different techniques for correcting selectivity bias at the domain level, which most often will be individuals.

Syllabus
A. Collecting through web browser emulator
Modern websites usually have interactive components. We focus on using web browser emulators, namely Selenium web driver, for exploiting those components programmatically.
The use-case of this module is a real-estate rental platform, where rent prices are collected.
The collection methods used for this platform are applicable for several e-commerce websites which present a similar catalogue structure for exhibiting their products.
B. Collecting through API s
Large and medium size web platforms commonly expose their data through web Application Programming Interfaces (API s). We learn how those can be easily manipulated through general open source libraries as requests or dedicated libraries in the case of large platforms as Facebook with the Facebook Marketing SDK official library.
The Facebook modules were inspired on the amazing work done by our colleagues from Qatar Computing Research Institute at HBKU, UNICEF, MIT Media Lab, iMMAP Colombia and the Global Protection Cluster from UNHCR, entitled  Real-Time Monitoring of the Venezuelan Exodus through Facebook s Advertising Platform  (see publication here).
C. Analyzing and visualizing web derived data
The analysis of web collected data is challenging because this data is frequently noisy and biased. We study how these challenges can be addressed by adequate modeling techniques. Additionally, visualizing as a means for extracting knowledge from data, is also fundamental when treating with web collected data.
We cover some basic cleaning procedures, different Machine Learning models and also static and interactive visualizations. Everything using the most popular Open Source libraries from Python Data-Science stack.

"200",200,"Machine learning on satellite imagery","About
Skills in Machine Learning (ML) are ubiquitous for 21st century statisticians or Data Scientists. In this course you will be introduced to this field of science by covering the most popular tasks from supervised and unsupervised ML.
Motivated by the fact that remote-sensing imagery is already being used to address development issues, i.e. revealing changes in soil quality or water availability, informing agricultural interventions and even measuring poverty; we structured this course around ML methods which can be applied to satellite imagery, aiming to help statistical teams to leverage this modern and omnipresent data source.
Subject matter
The use of Big Data is accelerating within the development and humanitarian practice.

Syllabus
A. Introduction to supervised Machine Learning
Methods from supervised machine learning are those which have progressed more in both academic and industrial environments. We cover the task of classification, training a model for being able to categorize the observations we give to it. We examine algorithms as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Gradient Boosted Trees and Neural Networks going though its theoretical basis and applying them in practice.
B. Introduction to unsupervised Machine Learning
Unsupervised machine learning is currently the second most popular area of the field. We will cover the task of clustering, forming groups of observations which are similar in a previously defined sense. We will go through the theoretical principles and we will put in practice different algorithms such as k-means, Gaussian Mixture Model and others, which are popular in the field of computer vision.
C. Case study: Satellite imagery for measuring urban extent (SDG 11.3.1)
This case-study is developed with Landsat 8 satellite images, which are free and accessible for everyone. Both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods presented previously will be used to be able to infer urban extent from open satellite images, as part of the calculation of the SDG  11.3.1 (Tier 2).
We focus this exercise in using satellite imagery to bridge data gaps in measuring SDG the mentioned Tier 2 indicator, this means it is  conceptually clear, has an internationally established methodology and standards are available, but for which data is not regularly produced by countries .
 
									, About
Skills in Machine Learning (ML) are ubiquitous for 21st century statisticians or Data Scientists. In this course you will be introduced to this field of science by covering the most popular tasks from supervised and unsupervised ML., Motivated by the fact that remote-sensing imagery is already being used to address development issues, i.e. revealing changes in soil quality or water availability, informing agricultural interventions and even measuring poverty; we structured this course around ML methods which can be applied to satellite imagery, aiming to help statistical teams to leverage this modern and omnipresent data source., Subject matter
The use of Big Data is accelerating within the development and humanitarian practice. If used right, its implementation can foster inclusion, efficiency, and lower project costs which may benefit public and private organizations involved on development programs.
