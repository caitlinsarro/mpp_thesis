"1","Planning for Climate Change in African Cities","Climate change poses a threat to economic growth and long-term prosperity of many countries around the world. Africa is not an exception, considering the actual and potential impacts of climate change and climate variability that will threaten its vulnerable sectors and human populations. African countries are projected to experience changing rainfall patterns, rising sea levels, and higher temperatures that will affect food security, agricultural production, water availability, and public health, among others. These climate change impacts and climate variability can further produce social and political problems, such as rural-urban migration and water resource disputes.   , Furthermore, the low levels of development in many African countries, as well as limited institutional, infrastructural, and technical capacities to respond successfully to climate change impacts and climate variability, can exacerbate the situation. In terms of contribution to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, although African countries are the lightest polluters, it has also become apparent that alternative energy sources can offset the increasing energy demand and dependence on biomass. Addressing climate change offers possibilities for low-carbon development. Moreover, there are promising mechanisms that can address both climate change actions and development goals simultaneously. 

At the city level, strengthening resilience, or the ability to respond to and absorb the effects of a hazardous event in a timely and efficient manner and to sustain this ability in the future, and adaptation; the process of adjusting to actual or expected climate change stimuli or their effects, should be at the forefront of planning.  Local governments have an important role to play through the provision of adequate infrastructure, regulation of land use, and other public services that are crucial for urban resilience. Mobilizing local governments, in collaboration with national governments, non-governmental organizations, and international organizations, among others, is also critical for an integrated multi-sectoral approach to climate change. 

The Course on Planning for Climate Change in African Cities provides the foundation for understanding cities<U+0092> exposure and sensitivity to climate change, and how cities can manage these impacts in the face of growing uncertainty. It does so by introducing the basic concepts of urban resilience and adaptation, by using illustrative case studies in different African cities. Furthermore, this module provides lectures on the different approaches for climate change planning, whether ad hoc, strategic or mainstreaming; introduces the different steps in the planning cycle <U+0096> from initial assessment to monitoring and evaluation; and presents the different decision support and assessment tools for prioritizing climate change actions. This course broadens the discussion on planning for climate change by engaging learners to apply their knowledge and practice their decision-making skills in a simulated exercise.

In line with development that minimizes the harm caused by climate change impacts, while maximizing the many human development opportunities presented by a more resilient future, we ask: what are the connections between urban risk and vulnerability? How is climate change and urban resilience conceptualized and applied in practice? Which policies and measures should be introduced to address climate change? Finally, how to choose among different measures that address climate change adaptation, urban resilience, and other development objectives? 

Course Objectives:
At the end of this course, learners should be able to:

"6","Climate Change and Water in Mountains: A Global Concern","What is climate change ? How are mountain regions affected by the evolution of water resources and their uses ? What kind of risks need to be considered ? , Mountains are recognized as particularly sensitive physical environments where intense and rapid changes have in the past, and may increasingly in the future, place pressure on their resource base. 

In this context, a team of roughly 100 experts worked from 2008 to 2013 for the European ACQWA project (www.acqwa.ch) which was coordinated by the University of Geneva. The primary objectives of the project were to assess the impacts of a changing climate on the quantity and quality of water originating in mountain regions, particularly where snow- and ice melt represent a large, sometimes the largest, streamflow component. A further objective of the project was to determine the potential disruptions to water-dependent economic activities related to the climate impacts on hydrological systems, and to propose a portfolio of possible adaptation strategies.

This particular MOOC is inspired by the ACQWA Project and offers a better understanding of climate change, its impacts on the quality and quantity of water in mountain regions and the risks related to changing water resources. From an interdisciplinary perspective, the participation of twenty-five instructors from five different countries (Switzerland, England, South Korea, India and Nepal) and fourteen institutions (UNIGE, RTS, UNIFR, UZH, ETHZ, Meteodat GmbH, WGMS, Imperial College London, Agroscope, R<e9>publique et Canton de Gen<e8>ve, Yonsei University, IHCAP, ICIMOD, SDC, FOEN) highlights the diversity of both theoretical and practical viewpoints related to these issues.

At the end of this course you will be able to understand key scientific principles, identify and address misconceptions, and contribute confidently to conversations about climate change."
"12","Climate Adaptation in Africa","This course explores why climate change adaptation is important in the African context. Africa is considered one to be one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change.   Historically, climate-related hazards such as drought, flooding, pest and disease outbreaks, coastal storms and heat waves have had devastating impacts on people and the environment in which they live. Often the damage knocks back progress that has been made in social and economic development, slowing down the achievement of development goals.  Climate models suggest that many of these climatic hazards will intensify as the global climate warms. Building resilience to climate risks, through adaptation, is critically important for future development in Africa., The course will examine adaptation in theory and in practice, through a focus on four sectors that are critically important for climate resilient development in Africa: Water Security, Agriculture and Food Security, Ecosystems and Ecosystem Services and Resilient Cities."

3) a focus on Southern countries, developed by AFD speakers.

Here are the learning goals for the entire training program:

Goal 1: Be able to understand the relationship between the energy transition, the ecological transition, the role of energy in our economy, our economic development model, and financing issues. 
Goal 2: Know how to advocate for and lobby on issues and on the need to change reality in order to implement strategies and action plans.
Goal 3: Be able to make a link between the Energy transition and financing solutions, and between comprehension and action.  
No one questions the imperative need to ensure development based on personal well-being and a fair distribution of wealth.

The Challenges of a Transition for All  
Until now the development of Northern countries has been based on an increasing exploitation of energy resources and a greater freedom of trade and exchange at the global scale. We now know that such a model is no longer sustainable, due to global warming and to the overexploitation of resources, which lead to health, social, and environmental disasters.

The Role of Developing Countries
With that in mind, how can we ensure fair and equitable growth for all? What role do countries from the different regions in the South have to play in this complete upheaval of the current economic, trade, and political models in order to achieve an effective energy and ecological transition?
  
A MOOC to Respond to these Questions
This free online training offers complementary perspectives from several specialists of issues related to climate change and the development of Southern countries. They will share their very practical understanding of the current crises and the answers that can be provided. Participants will learn from studies by:
<U+0095> Researchers from the prestigious <c9>cole Normale Sup<e9>rieure in Paris
<U+0095> Field experts from the Agence Fran<e7>aise de D<e9>veloppement, a funding agency that has been committed to helping developing countries for 75 years,
<U+0095> Carbone 4 founder Alain Grandjean, who will share his experience, in particular on the economic and financial aspects.
 
Here is the program: 
1.       Our development model is ecologically unsustainable
2.       The dominant economic models hinder the energy and ecological transition
3.       The energy transition path: decarbonizing GDP
4.       The model of an ecological transition to new prosperity
5.       Governance of the energy and ecological transition
6.       Financing the energy and ecological transition"
"28","Anti-Corruption in the context of the 2030 Agenda","The 2030 Agenda was a major breakthrough for the anti-corruption movement, as it emphasizes the importance of promoting transparency, accountability and anti-corruption for sustainable development, and makes an explicit link between corruption, peace and just and inclusive societies.
UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner said, <U+0093>the 2030 Agenda has established anti-corruption as a global imperative on which hinges the achievement of all sustainable development goals. Goal 16 is rooted in human rights and highlights the importance of strengthening institutions and governance in our pledge to leave no one behind. We also have the opportunity to advance the anti-corruption agenda through the implementation of the UN Convention Against Corruption, which has now reached near-universal ratification, providing a comprehensive global framework to fight corruption in alignment with the 2030 Agenda. Corruption is a complex challenge that continues to persist in many countries across the world. It has a direct impact on the three dimensions of sustainable development <U+0096> social, economic and environmental <U+0096> and affects each of the five pillars of the 2030 agenda: people, planet, prosperity, peace and partnerships.<U+0094>
Despite progress made, corruption is still a pressing challenge. Resources lost through corruption exceed the estimated 10 trillion dollars required to eradicate poverty by 2030. Money lost to corruption is essentially development denied to those most at risk of being left behind.

By providing an internationally agreed standard with agreed concepts, definitions and classifications, the SEEA is an invaluable tool for compiling integrated statistics on the economy and the environment. The SEEA framework follows a similar accounting structure to the System of National Accounts (SNA). The SEEA uses concepts, definitions and classifications consistent with the SNA in order to facilitate the integration of environmental and economic statistics. By doing so, the SEEA allows us to develop indicators and conduct analysis on the economy-environment nexus.
The SEEA facilitates better informed decision-making. The SEEA Central Framework offers a means of monitoring pressures exerted by the economy on the environment, in terms of abstraction of natural resources and emissions; impacts in terms of changes in stocks of natural resources; and how the economy responds in terms of expenditure on environmental protection and resource management. The SEEA does not propose particular indicators, but is instead a holistic multi-purpose information system that can generate a wide range of statistics and indicators with varying potential analytical applications.
The course is self-paced without instruction and can be taken at any point in time.

Countries are called on to<U+00A0><U+0093>implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors, and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable.<U+0094>
Currently, an estimated 69.4 per cent of the world<U+0092>s population lives without adequate social protection coverage, including lack of access to a pension, unemployment benefits, health insurance, and income guarantees.
According to the International Labour Organization, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has simultaneously,<U+00A0><U+0093>exposed deep-seated inequalities and significant gaps in social protection coverage, comprehensiveness and adequacy across all countries<U+0094> and, <U+0093>provoked an unparalleled social protection policy response<U+0094>. It is therefore time to accelerate the transformation of social protection systems in light of the pandemic, to ensure human-centred recovery and resilience.
The ambitious objectives of the 2030 Agenda and the newfound drive for building comprehensive social protection systems will require concerted efforts from across the spectrum of UN and national actors, joining up disparate interventions and leveraging new tools to build enhanced social protection programmes and achieve the 2030 target.

Countries are called on to<U+00A0><U+0093>implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors, and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable.<U+0094>, Currently, an estimated 69.4 per cent of the world<U+0092>s population lives without adequate social protection coverage, including lack of access to a pension, unemployment benefits, health insurance, and income guarantees., According to the International Labour Organization, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has simultaneously,<U+00A0><U+0093>exposed deep-seated inequalities and significant gaps in social protection coverage, comprehensiveness and adequacy across all countries<U+0094> and, <U+0093>provoked an unparalleled social protection policy response<U+0094>. It is therefore time to accelerate the transformation of social protection systems in light of the pandemic, to ensure human-centred recovery and resilience., The ambitious objectives of the 2030 Agenda and the newfound drive for building comprehensive social protection systems will require concerted efforts from across the spectrum of UN and national actors, joining up disparate interventions and leveraging new tools to build enhanced social protection programmes and achieve the 2030 target.,

"38","SEEA: In Depth Training on Energy Accounting","The System for Environmental-Economic Accounting-Energy (SEEA-Energy) is a multi-purpose conceptual framework for organizing energy-related statistics. It supports analysis of the role of energy within the economy, the state of energy inputs and various energy-related transactions of environmental interest. It is fully consistent with the SEEA Central Framework. Energy information is typically presented in physical terms, but the SEEA-Energy also applies monetary valuations to various stocks and flows, based on the SEEA accounting approach.The SEEA-Energy is consistent with the SEEA Central Framework and follows a similar accounting structure to the System of National Accounts (SNA). The SEEA-Energy uses concepts, definitions and classifications consistent with the SNA in order to facilitate the integration of energy and economic statistics. By doing so, the SEEA-Energy allows us to develop indicators and conduct analysis on the economy-environment nexus, with a focus on energy.
The SEEA-Energy facilitates better informed decision-making, particularly for energy policy, climate policy and natural resource management. The SEEA-Energy offers a means of monitoring pressures exerted by the economy on the environment, in terms of extraction of energy from the environment; impacts in terms of changes in stocks of energy resources and air emissions; and how the economy responds in terms of expenditure on environmental protection and resource management. The SEEA-Energy does not propose particular indicators, but is instead a holistic multi-purpose information system that can generate a wide range of statistics and indicators with varying potential analytical applications. For example, Goal 7 of the SDGs focuses specifically on energy, and the SEEA-Energy methdology can play an important role in measuring these targets by providing a framework for the development of indicators.

ABSTRACT
Plastic pollution is entering our oceans at an alarming rate, damaging our marine environments and endangering local livelihoods. The Asia-Pacific is an important centre of innovation for plastic waste management and a hotspot for pollution. Across the region, cities and city governments are at the frontier of global efforts to stop plastic waste entering the environment. 
This course was developed for the Closing the Loop project by UN ESCAP in partnership with the Government of Japan. Closing the Loop aims to reduce the environmental impact of cities in ASEAN by addressing plastic waste pollution in the marine environment. In support of the ASEAN Framework of Action on Marine Debris and the G20 Osaka Blue Ocean Vision, the project will bring a more circular approach to plastic waste management and reduce the amount of waste entering the marine environment.
This course was developed to facilitate local government capacity building on the topic of marine plastic waste. Course development was led by UN ESCAP in collaboration with Ocean Conservancy, UN Environment Programme (UNEP), the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES), Women in Informal Employment: Globalizing and Organizing (WIEGO), Coordinating Body on the Seas of East Asia (COBSEA), Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), the International Solid Waste Association (ISWA), Plymouth Marine Lab, Wageningen University & Research, Keio University and the University of Leeds.

"57","Integrating Climate Risk Information into NAPs","At its 21st session, the UNFCCC Conference of Parties (COP-21) emphasized the importance of accelerated adaptation planning and implementation. As of August 2017, 152 Parties to the Convention out of 197 have submitted their first Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to the UNFCCC, with 102 including an adaptation component, the majority being developing countries. The UNFCCC report released in October 2016 on progress in the process of formulating and implementing National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) indicates that many more countries, including over 80% of Least Developed Countries (LDCs), have embarked on developing a NAP.
The development and implementation of NAPs involve decisions related to climate risk management, which require reliable, relevant, usable and timely climate information.
Climate information used within the NAP process encompasses a wide range of information on past, present and future climate, and products which help improve the understanding of climate and its impacts on natural and human systems and support decisions to improve climate-related outcomes. Climate services involve the production, translation, transfer and use of climate knowledge and information for this purpose. Climate services, therefore, play a crucial role in the planning, financing and implementation of adaptation to climate change.
In this context and drawing on the WMO-led Global Framework for Climate Services (GFCS), WMO and UNITAR developed capacity building e-learning materials in support of a wider training package on <U+0093>Integration Climate Risk Information into National Adaptation Planning<U+0094>. The aim of this e-learning component is to contribute to capacity building that will bridge the information and communication gaps currently affecting the demand for climate information services and their supply.

The course is designed to respond the learning needs of both climate services providers (National Hydro-meteorological Services, research/academic and international organizations), and users (e.g. decision makers, private investors, non-governmental organizations, etc.), as well as of those working at the science-policy interface for outreach or communication purposes.
The training is modular<U+00A0> and provides you with the liberty to<U+00A0> choose and combine different thematic modules. There are two main themes or learning tracks available as illustrated in the figure below.
Learning track 1 (green-colored): Producing climate information for NAPs
Learning track 2 (yellow-colored):<U+00A0>Using climate information for NAPs
Both learning tracks have in common the Intro and Wrap-up modules.
How to choose the learning track that best suits your profile and learning needs?
Once you complete the Intro module, you are recommended to undertake a test. Based on your answers to the five questions of the test you will be advised to follow either learning track 1 or 2, or both.
Each learning track culminates with a quiz that will assess the knowledge you will acquire. If you pass the quiz with a minimum mark of 70%, a certificate of completion will be issued to you. If you choose to follow both learning tracks you can receive two certificates by passing both quizzes.

"59","Financing in Health","Results Based Financing (RBF) for Health is an interactive course that includes narrated presentations, discussion forums, group work and a quiz for each module to assess your knowledge.
The course is based on materials developed over the course of several years for the delivery of face-to-face RBF learning events, which generated a rich repository of knowledge. That knowledge has been translated into e-learning modules to reach a critical mass of health practitioners globally. The course aims to equip participants with specific knowledge to help determine whether RBF is an appropriate tool for their context and if so, what type of RBF approach may be appropriate to adopt.
The e-learning course is supported by funding from the Health Results Innovation Trust Fund (HRITF). Since 2007, HRITF has been pioneering RBF programs, with a particular focus on improving maternal and child health outcomes to accelerate progress towards Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 1c, 4 and 5. Learn more:<U+00A0>www.rbfhealth.org<U+00A0>or<U+00A0>www.facebook.com/RBFhealth<U+00A0>and<U+00A0>www.twitter.com/RBFhealth.
Please take a moment to listen to the course introduction by Petra Vergeer, who is one of the main coordinators of this e-learning course and who helped develop and taught the material in this course in its face-to-face version.
Course context
Traditionally, government and donor funds to improve health service delivery have concentrated on increasing critical inputs, such as infrastructure, equipment, supplies, drugs and vaccines. Since the adoption of the Millennium Declaration in 2000, this development assistance for health has more than doubled. And yet the increase in investments has not translated into the expected health outcomes in low and middle income countries. The challenge these countries face is unequal access and utilization of essential health services, often due to low quality of services, inefficient delivery of services and limited management capacity. In addition, poor households in many countries face impoverishment due to limited financial protection in the health system. Consequently, many countries, especially those in Africa, risk not achieving the MDGs for maternal and child health by 2015.
As a result, many governments and development agencies have been motivated to try new innovations and approaches that can boost health system functioning. RBF is one approach that is gaining momentum with country governments and development partners. RBF links financing to pre-determined results such as the actual use of health services, as well as their quality, and as opposed to financing inputs such as medical equipment or supplies. The experience so far shows promising results, especially in terms of increased utilization of key maternal and child health services. In addition, RBF is seen as a way to strengthen core health systems, making them more accountable and efficient by delivering greater value for money.
A vital aspect for any successful RBF approach is ensuring the appropriateness of the strategy for a particular context, which is at the core of this e-learning course. The World Bank Group and its partners has undertaken many capacity building engagements on RBF, including:
Consultations with key stakeholders.
Study tours from countries considering or starting RBF to those already implementing them.
Knowledge and lessons-sharing events.
Technical training workshops for policy makers and other stakeholders.
Peer-to-peer exchange forums.
These programs are geared at informed decision-making on the appropriateness of RBF and building implementation capacity to mitigate the risk of failure in implementing RBF mechanisms. This e-learning platform is designed to complement these initiatives, and to: equip participants with the tools to decide whether RBF may be an appropriate policy option to consider in addressing health system challenges; and to be able to apply RBF design and implementation concepts/principles.
The objectives of the course are to:
Provide background knowledge on RBF and its different approaches.
Introduce core principles of RBF for health.
Provide some country examples of RBF for health in practice.

"70","Unleashing the Power of the Private Sector for the 2030 Agenda - 2021","Registrations open from 10 February to 10 April
The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is unprecedented in its scope and ambition. The UN and governments have neither the reach nor the resources to implement it alone. Engagement, especially with the private sector, is imperative for the 2030 Agenda to succeed.
The private sector with its unparalleled reach has the capacity to be a key driver to achieve the objectives of the 2030 Agenda and in some cases is already performing this role. The UN and its member states must seize the opportunity to form strategic partnerships with private sector entities and advocate for businesses to embrace sustainable development in order to achieve the 2030 Agenda.
Moreover, the 2030 Agenda offers the private sector numerous opportunities to access new markets and institutional investment, estimated at about $12 trillion by 2030 while adding 380 million new jobs. This in itself is a compelling argument for the private sector and governments to work together to make the 2030 Agenda a reality.

"77","Air Quality Management","Air pollution has become a major challenge to global health with the latest estimates from the Global Burden of Disease project suggesting that in 2015, nearly six and one-half million people died prematurely either from air pollution in their outdoor environment or from air pollution associated with the use of solid biofuels for cooking and heating in homes. Unfortunately, most of these deaths are now occurring in the developing world. The World Bank is moving to address this major public health challenge through its Environmental Health and Pollution Management business line with the launch of the<U+00A0>Pollution Management and Environmental Health<U+00A0>(PMEH)<U+00A0>multi-donor trust fund, through pilot programs to demonstrate how to improve air quality in specific cities, through research to improve our understanding of where air pollution is most prevalent and through learning products such as this online e-learning course.
This<U+00A0>Air Quality Management series of courses has been created for development professionals, government officials, and other partners who want to learn about the fundamentals of air quality management planning. Successful air quality management programs can reduce emissions that lead to air pollution while simultaneously providing other development benefits that accrue locally as well as globally. Benefits can include improved public health, energy savings, economic development, agricultural benefits, and reduced emissions of greenhouse gases and other short-lived climate pollution. We hope this introductory course provides the foundation for establishing such a program in your community and that follow-up courses will provide skills and information on how to monitor air pollution and increase public awareness, how to develop emission inventories and track progress, how to assess the benefits of air quality improvement, how to select control strategies that are most effective and finally these courses will share information on the importance of stakeholder engagement and describe regulatory approaches that have been most effective elsewhere.
Designing and implementing an effective Air Quality Management (AQM) program relies on a complete understanding of the specific issues affecting a given region, requiring awareness raising, data collection and capacity building. This course provides a basic introduction to concepts of air pollution and its management.
									, Air pollution has become a major challenge to global health with the latest estimates from the Global Burden of Disease project suggesting that in 2015, nearly six and one-half million people died prematurely either from air pollution in their outdoor environment or from air pollution associated with the use of solid biofuels for cooking and heating in homes. Unfortunately, most of these deaths are now occurring in the developing world. The World Bank is moving to address this major public health challenge through its Environmental Health and Pollution Management business line with the launch of the<U+00A0>Pollution Management and Environmental Health<U+00A0>(PMEH)<U+00A0>multi-donor trust fund, through pilot programs to demonstrate how to improve air quality in specific cities, through research to improve our understanding of where air pollution is most prevalent and through learning products such as this online e-learning course., This<U+00A0>Air Quality Management series of courses has been created for development professionals, government officials, and other partners who want to learn about the fundamentals of air quality management planning. Successful air quality management programs can reduce emissions that lead to air pollution while simultaneously providing other development benefits that accrue locally as well as globally. Benefits can include improved public health, energy savings, economic development, agricultural benefits, and reduced emissions of greenhouse gases and other short-lived climate pollution. We hope this introductory course provides the foundation for establishing such a program in your community and that follow-up courses will provide skills and information on how to monitor air pollution and increase public awareness, how to develop emission inventories and track progress, how to assess the benefits of air quality improvement, how to select control strategies that are most effective and finally these courses will share information on the importance of stakeholder engagement and describe regulatory approaches that have been most effective elsewhere., Designing and implementing an effective Air Quality Management (AQM) program relies on a complete understanding of the specific issues affecting a given region, requiring awareness raising, data collection and capacity building. This course provides a basic introduction to concepts of air pollution and its management.,

    , 
    The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted by UN Member States in 2015 affirms that <U+0093>the spread of information and communication technology and global interconnectedness has great potential to accelerate human progress, to bridge the digital divide and to develop knowledge societies.<U+0094> Women<U+0092>s empowerment through E-Government can, indeed, accelerate the achievement of Goals and Targets across the 2030 Agenda. The new EGovforWomen Online Toolkit directly contributes to Sustainable Development Goals 5, 9, 10 and 16.

This online platform is an innovative public resource related to the design and implementation of gender-responsive E-government institutional ecosystems in the Asia-Pacific region. The toolkit represents the first region-wide toolbox to support the gender-mainstreaming of E-Government.<U+00A0> Through a set of 5 comprehensive modules, it provides key pointers for policymakers on gender-responsive design of e-service delivery, e-participation and connectivity initiatives, and introduces a capabilities-based approach to outcome evaluation of e-government for women<U+0092>s empowerment.

Gender, governance and e-government
	Gender-responsive e-service delivery
	Gender-responsive e-participation
	Gender-responsive connectivity architecture
	Assessing gender-responsiveness of e-government ecosystems
Each module is oriented towards a clearly identified target group, and is geared towards the attainment of specific learning outcomes. Therefore, all modules have clearly delineated sub-units to enable step-by-step learning and exercises/ assignments to test knowledge attainments (including a case study, food for thought, group assignments and quizzes). Content of the modules is drawn from the regional research on e-government for women<U+0092>s empowerment in Asia and the Pacific conducted by UNESCAP and IT for Change in 2015-16; as well as a scan of open source documentation of good practices in gender and e-government in the region, and in other contexts.

In the implementation of this project, ESCAP has partnered with IT for Change, India (www.ITforChange.net). IT for Change is a not-for-profit organisation that seeks to build a socially just and gender-equitable information society for the global South. Towards this, it is engaged in policy research, advocacy and field practice in the domains of gender, digital technologies and development; ICTs in education; e-government; Internet governance, digital rights; and data for development. At IT for Change, this project was led by Anita Gurumurthy, Executive Director with support from Nandini Chami, Senior Research Associate.

This project has been made possible with the generous funding from the Government of the Republic of Korea, through the Korea-ESCAP Cooperation Fund (KECF).

Your scholarship application will not be taken into consideration if you have not registered on this page first., Following the UN Summer Academy. I was inspired to put together a guide for museums on the SDGs that is distributed globally. I have more confidence in all my speaking engagements at conferences and webinars when I talk about sustainable development., Since the program was convened online, it made me realize the importance of leveraging technological solutions and building momentum over social media for sustainable actions and for a better world for youth, women, and all those marginalized., The UN Summer Academy significantly impacted my perspective of the 2030 Agenda and how much transformation in our global <U+0093>business-as-usual<U+0094> model is needed to move us toward the SDGs., The UN Summer Academy gave me a unique experience. It helped me design a future by using different learning approaches, understanding current megatrends from a new perspective, and influencing different types of solutions. From fast-paced working groups to plenaries, role plays, and virtual learning spaces through Share Fairs, UNSA helped form a <U+0093>tribe<U+0094> equipped to deliver the 2030 Agenda., The UN Summer Academy changed my perception of today<U+0092>s complex problems and how we can solve them through Systems Thinking, Futures Thinking, and Design Thinking. I also had the opportunity to hear from experts on the latest developments in sustainable development and from participants about their projects. One of the most critical takeaways from the UN Summer Academy was meeting people and hearing their stories., I keep telling people around me about my UN Summer Academy experience, what we learned, and HOW we learned together. I also feel more empowered to talk about the sustainable development goals (SDG) and work with future scenarios in my daily work in the transformation of energy systems., I have not stopped talking to my colleagues about the UN Summer Academy and its positive approach to daunting challenges! I will apply what I have learned and use the same engagement method with my colleagues and peers. I hope to model a similar workshop after your approach."

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is unprecedented in its scope and ambition. The UN and governments have neither the reach nor the resources to implement it alone. Engagement, especially with the private sector, is imperative for the 2030 Agenda to succeed.
The private sector with its unparalleled reach has the capacity to be a key driver to achieve the objectives of the 2030 Agenda and in some cases is already performing this role. The UN and its member states must seize the opportunity to form strategic partnerships with private sector entities and advocate for businesses to embrace sustainable development in order to achieve the 2030 Agenda.
Moreover, the 2030 Agenda offers the private sector numerous opportunities to access new markets and institutional investment, estimated at about $12 trillion by 2030 while adding 380 million new jobs. This in itself is a compelling argument for the private sector and governments to work together to make the 2030 Agenda a reality.

"170","Constructing Producer Price Indexes and Import and Export Price Indexes","The Producer Price Index (PPI) is a family of indexes that measures the average change over time in the selling prices received by domestic producers of goods and services. PPIs measure price change from the perspective of the seller. This contrasts with other measures, such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) which measures price change from the purchaser<U+0092>s perspective. Sellers<U+0092> and purchasers<U+0092> prices may differ due to government subsides, sales and excise taxes, and distribution costs.
Producer Price Index data are widely used by the business community as well as government. Three major uses are:
As an economic indicator. The PPIs capture price movements prior to the retail level. Therefore, they may foreshadow subsequent price changes for businesses and consumers. National leaders and central banks employ these data in formulating fiscal and monetary policies.
As a deflator of other economic series. PPIs are used to adjust other economic time series for price changes and to translate those series into inflation-free currency values. For example, constant-dollar gross domestic product data are estimated using deflators based on PPI data.
As the basis for contract escalation. PPI data are commonly used in escalating purchase and sales contracts. These contracts typically specify cost amounts to be paid at some point in the future. It is often desirable to include an escalation clause that accounts for increases in input prices. (See<U+00A0>BLS Report 807, Escalation and Producer Price Indexes: A Guide for Contracting Parties.)
Import and Export Price Indexes (MXP) are a family of indexes that measure the average change over time in the prices of nonmilitary goods and services traded between the domestic country and the rest of the world. The MXPs help to answer the question <U+0093>how will trade affect the production of goods and services in the economy?<U+0094> and are primarily used to deflate various foreign trade statistics.
Participants are encouraged to bring with them the following materials for use in discussions and workshops: 1) methodological documentation on how data related to the seminar topic are collected in their home countries; 2) questionnaires used in their countries for obtaining those data; and 3) sample publications of those data.

"176","Introduction to the SEEA Central Framework","The System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA) 2012<U+0097>Central Framework is a multipurpose conceptual framework for measuring the interactions between the environment and the economy. By providing an internationally agreed standard with agreed concepts, definitions and classifications, the SEEA is an invaluable tool for compiling integrated statistics on the economy and the environment. The SEEA framework follows a similar accounting structure to the System of National Accounts (SNA). The SEEA uses concepts, definitions and classifications consistent with the SNA in order to facilitate the integration of environmental and economic statistics. By doing so, the SEEA allows us to develop indicators and conduct analysis on the economy-environment nexus.
The SEEA facilitates better informed decision-making. The SEEA Central Framework offers a means of monitoring pressures exerted by the economy on the environment, in terms of abstraction of natural resources and emissions; impacts in terms of changes in stocks of natural resources; and how the economy responds in terms of expenditure on environmental protection and resource management. The SEEA does not propose particular indicators, but is instead a holistic multi-purpose information system that can generate a wide range of statistics and indicators with varying potential analytical applications.
The course is self-paced without instruction and can be taken at any point in time.

"177","National metadata for SDGs","The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, sets forth the global vision to 2030. At its heart are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which provide the benchmarks that should be achieved by 2030 in order to leave no one behind. A robust follow-up and review mechanism for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda requires a solid framework of indicators and statistical data to monitor progress, inform policy and ensure accountability of all stakeholders at the global and national level. The global indicator framework consisting of 169 targets and 242 indicators was adopted by the General Assembly in 2017.
At the national level, the 2030 Agenda encourages member states to conduct regular and inclusive reviews of progress at the national and sub-national levels which are country-led and country-driven. The United Nations Statistics Division is working closely with national actors as well as international partners to build capacity in countries for reporting on the SDG indicators using national indicator frameworks.
National metadata are an important element in better understanding how the SDG indicator has been collected, processed and disseminated. The global metadata set can be used as guidance, but source and processing information will be different in each country and for each data source. Definitions and concepts may also vary and it is important to sensitise the user to this.
This is an e-learning course in how to compile national metadata for the SDGs. After introducing the SDGs overall and key metadata concepts, it provides guidance in how to fill a metadata template for SDG indicators. The e-learning course is based on trainings which have been conducted as part of the UNSD-DFID project on SDG monitoring.

"178","Integrating Climate Risk Information into NAPs","At its 21st session, the UNFCCC Conference of Parties (COP-21) emphasized the importance of accelerated adaptation planning and implementation. As of August 2017, 152 Parties to the Convention out of 197 have submitted their first Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to the UNFCCC, with 102 including an adaptation component, the majority being developing countries. The UNFCCC report released in October 2016 on progress in the process of formulating and implementing National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) indicates that many more countries, including over 80% of Least Developed Countries (LDCs), have embarked on developing a NAP.
The development and implementation of NAPs involve decisions related to climate risk management, which require reliable, relevant, usable and timely climate information.
Climate information used within the NAP process encompasses a wide range of information on past, present and future climate, and products which help improve the understanding of climate and its impacts on natural and human systems and support decisions to improve climate-related outcomes. Climate services involve the production, translation, transfer and use of climate knowledge and information for this purpose. Climate services, therefore, play a crucial role in the planning, financing and implementation of adaptation to climate change.
In this context and drawing on the WMO-led Global Framework for Climate Services (GFCS), WMO and UNITAR developed capacity building e-learning materials in support of a wider training package on <U+0093>Integration Climate Risk Information into National Adaptation Planning<U+0094>. The aim of this e-learning component is to contribute to capacity building that will bridge the information and communication gaps currently affecting the demand for climate information services and their supply.

The course is designed to respond the learning needs of both climate services providers (National Hydro-meteorological Services, research/academic and international organizations), and users (e.g. decision makers, private investors, non-governmental organizations, etc.), as well as of those working at the science-policy interface for outreach or communication purposes.
The training is modular<U+00A0> and provides you with the liberty to<U+00A0> choose and combine different thematic modules. There are two main themes or learning tracks available as illustrated in the figure below.
Learning track 1 (green-colored): Producing climate information for NAPs
Learning track 2 (yellow-colored):<U+00A0>Using climate information for NAPs
Both learning tracks have in common the Intro and Wrap-up modules.
How to choose the learning track that best suits your profile and learning needs?
Once you complete the Intro module, you are recommended to undertake a test. Based on your answers to the five questions of the test you will be advised to follow either learning track 1 or 2, or both.
Each learning track culminates with a quiz that will assess the knowledge you will acquire. If you pass the quiz with a minimum mark of 70%, a certificate of completion will be issued to you. If you choose to follow both learning tracks you can receive two certificates by passing both quizzes.

Data on employed persons and the unemployment rate provide a vital snapshot of the strength of a labor market. A range of measures of labor underutilization and other employment data produced by BLS will also be discussed.
Wages and Labor Costs
Wages, earnings, and benefits account for a substantial part of a country<U+0092>s national income and are closely linked to the economic cycle. Determining levels and trends of pay rates by occupation, industry, locality, and region is important in the analysis of current economic developments. The seminar will also discuss indexes that measure the change over time in labor costs (Employment Cost Index) and data measuring the level of average costs per hour worked (Employer Costs for Employee Compensation).
Prices
Price indexes, indicators of the rates of inflation in a country<U+0092>s economy, also serve as a tool for adjusting wages, salaries, and other income payments to keep in step with rising prices. The seminar will address the importance of Consumer Price Indexes, Producer Price Indexes, and Import and Export Price Indexes.
Productivity and Unit Labor Costs
Productivity is one of the major determinants of the standard of living, since increases in productivity can result in higher real income and increased price stability. Measures of productivity and unit labor costs are important signals of international competitiveness.
<U+00A0>
Data discussed in this seminar are used to report on the following SDG indicators:
Indicator 5.4.1: Proportion of time spent on unpaid domestic and care work, by sex, age and location
Indicator 8.2.1: Annual growth rate of real GDP per employed person
Indicator 8.5.1: Average hourly earnings of female and male employees, by occupation, age and persons with disabilities
Indicator 8.5.2: Unemployment rate, by sex, age and persons with disabilities
Indicator 8.6.1: Proportion of youth (aged 15<U+0096>24 years) not in education, employment or training
Indicator 9.2.2: Manufacturing employment as a proportion of total employment
, Timely and sound economic data are of critical importance to policymakers, the business community, consumers, and investors. Economic information helps a wide array of people assess how well an economy is performing and guides decision-making. What are economic indicators? What is their significance? How should they be interpreted? This seminar is an introduction to key economic indicators and how they are used.

The Central Framework looks at <U+0093>individual environmental assets<U+0094>, such as water resources, energy resources, etc. and how those assets move between the environment and the economy. In contrast, the SEEA EEA takes the perspective of ecosystems and considers how individual environmental assets interact as part of natural processes within a given spatial area. Ecosystem accounting takes a spatial approach, often utilizing earth observation and geospatial data. Using this spatial approach, the SEEA EEA accounts for the extent and condition of ecosystems, the flow of services provided by ecosystems and the contributions and benefits of ecosystems to economic and other human activity.
This course provides an overview of the SEEA EEA, including how the SEEA EEA can be used for policy. The course covers ecosystem extent, condition and service accounts as well as accounting for biodiversity, water and carbon.

"186","SEEA: In-depth Training on Water Accounting","The System of Environmental-Economic Accounts for Water (SEEA-Water) is an integrated approach to water monitoring, bringing together a wide range of water related statistics across sectors into one coherent information system. The SEEA-Water is the conceptual framework and set of accounts which presents hydrological information alongside economic information in a consistent way. The SEEA-Water is consistent with the SEEA Central Framework and follows a similar accounting structure to the System of National Accounts (SNA). The SEEA-Water uses concepts, definitions and classifications consistent with the SNA in order to facilitate the integration of environmental and economic statistics. By doing so, the SEEA-Water allows us to develop indicators and conduct analysis on the economy-environment nexus, with a focus on water.
The SEEA-Water facilitates better informed decision-making, particularly for integrated water resources management. The SEEA-Water offers a means of monitoring pressures exerted by the economy on the environment, in terms of abstraction of water from the environment; impacts in terms of changes in stocks of water; and how the economy responds in terms of expenditure on environmental protection and resource management. The SEEA-Water does not propose particular indicators, but is instead a holistic multi-purpose information system that can generate a wide range of statistics and indicators with varying potential analytical applications. For example, Goal 6 of the SDGs focuses specifically on water and includes calls for improving water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping and the release of hazardous materials, reducing the proportion of untreated wastewater and increasing recycling and safe reuse of water. The SEEA-Water methodology can play an important role in measuring these targets by providing a framework for the development of indicators.
The course is self-paced without instruction and can be taken at any point in time.

"222","SEEA: In Depth Training on Energy Accounting","The System for Environmental-Economic Accounting-Energy (SEEA-Energy) is a multi-purpose conceptual framework for organizing energy-related statistics. It supports analysis of the role of energy within the economy, the state of energy inputs and various energy-related transactions of environmental interest. It is fully consistent with the SEEA Central Framework. Energy information is typically presented in physical terms, but the SEEA-Energy also applies monetary valuations to various stocks and flows, based on the SEEA accounting approach.The SEEA-Energy is consistent with the SEEA Central Framework and follows a similar accounting structure to the System of National Accounts (SNA). The SEEA-Energy uses concepts, definitions and classifications consistent with the SNA in order to facilitate the integration of energy and economic statistics. By doing so, the SEEA-Energy allows us to develop indicators and conduct analysis on the economy-environment nexus, with a focus on energy.
The SEEA-Energy facilitates better informed decision-making, particularly for energy policy, climate policy and natural resource management. The SEEA-Energy offers a means of monitoring pressures exerted by the economy on the environment, in terms of extraction of energy from the environment; impacts in terms of changes in stocks of energy resources and air emissions; and how the economy responds in terms of expenditure on environmental protection and resource management. The SEEA-Energy does not propose particular indicators, but is instead a holistic multi-purpose information system that can generate a wide range of statistics and indicators with varying potential analytical applications. For example, Goal 7 of the SDGs focuses specifically on energy, and the SEEA-Energy methdology can play an important role in measuring these targets by providing a framework for the development of indicators.

"233","Labor Market Information: Household Labor Force Surveys","Labor market information is essential for tracking and analyzing the economy of a country. National and local governments need labor market information to reduce unemployment, generate employment, and plan training programs to meet the needs of industry. It is also used in determining future workforce training needs, identifying the availability of labor, ascertaining prevailing wage rates, and exploring potential markets. Labor market information is valuable to local and regional planning agencies as well as industries and businesses looking for site locations, seeking ways of attracting and retaining skilled workers, or assessing the scope and size of potential markets. Labor unions find this information useful for determining comparable wage and compensation levels, local working conditions, and training needs. Investors, educators, workers, and job seekers also benefit from timely and reliable labor market information to help them make sound decisions.

"234","Statistical methods for correcting selection bias","About
Just as questionnaires are the means for observing reality through surveys, electronic platforms have the same role for big data. Most of the big data sources offer a non-probabilistic sample of the population of study, where several errors are induced by self-selection of individuals present on the sample, targeting decisions from the owners of the electronic platform and limitations of the coverage of said platform.
In this course you will learn about the principal techniques for correcting bias through a statistical approach. This work is based on previous<U+00A0>research<U+00A0>work<U+00A0>from Data-Pop Alliance on correcting bias on mobile network data<U+00A0>and a fundamental<U+00A0>book<U+00A0>published by Eurostat.
Subject matter
The use of Big Data is accelerating within the development and humanitarian practice. If used right, its implementation can foster inclusion, efficiency, and lower project costs which may benefit public and private organizations involved on development programs.

Syllabus
A. Main challenges of big data as an statistical source
We define a statistical approach to big data and highlight the main challenges and opportunities it presents when trying to use it as a statistical source. We go through the specific difficulties of different big data sources of interest such as mobile network data, bank transactional data and social media among others.
B. Unit-level methods for correcting bias
Correcting selection bias in big data can be analogue to procedures used in other data sources which have the same problem of non-random selection and had been studied for a while: web or telephone opt-in surveys.
We will go through different techniques for correcting selectivity bias at the<U+00A0>unit of observation level, which most often will be individuals. Even if methods are analogue to those used in opt-in surveys, what you will learn in this course is how to use those procedures in massive data, by leveraging big data frameworks such as<U+00A0>Spark, through its easy-to-use Python API:<U+00A0>PySpark.
C. Domain-level methods for correcting bias
Correcting selection bias in big data can be analogue to procedures used in other data sources which have the same problem of non-random selection and had been studied for a while: web or telephone opt-in surveys.
We will go through different techniques for correcting selectivity bias at the<U+00A0>domain level, which most often will be individuals.

									, About
Just as questionnaires are the means for observing reality through surveys, electronic platforms have the same role for big data. Most of the big data sources offer a non-probabilistic sample of the population of study, where several errors are induced by self-selection of individuals present on the sample, targeting decisions from the owners of the electronic platform and limitations of the coverage of said platform., In this course you will learn about the principal techniques for correcting bias through a statistical approach. This work is based on previous<U+00A0>research<U+00A0>work<U+00A0>from Data-Pop Alliance on correcting bias on mobile network data<U+00A0>and a fundamental<U+00A0>book<U+00A0>published by Eurostat., Subject matter
The use of Big Data is accelerating within the development and humanitarian practice. If used right, its implementation can foster inclusion, efficiency, and lower project costs which may benefit public and private organizations involved on development programs. Therefore, our technical courses cover different aspects on data science and data engineering relevant for the context of official statistics and sustainable development., Methodology

Testimonial from a participant<U+00A0><U+0093>The whole course was excellent. It is great having the opportunity to participate in qualifications on modern issues relevant to our work<U+0094>.
Syllabus
A. Collecting through web browser emulator
Modern websites usually have interactive components. We focus on using web browser emulators, namely<U+00A0>Selenium<U+00A0>web driver, for exploiting those components programmatically.
The use-case of this module is a real-estate rental platform, where rent prices are collected.
The collection methods used for this platform are applicable for several e-commerce websites which present a similar catalogue structure for exhibiting their products.
B. Collecting through API<U+0092>s
Large and medium size web platforms commonly expose their data through web Application Programming Interfaces (API<U+0092>s). We learn how those can be easily manipulated through general open source libraries as<U+00A0>requests<U+00A0>or dedicated libraries in the case of large platforms as<U+00A0>Facebook<U+00A0>with the<U+00A0>Facebook Marketing SDK<U+00A0>official library.
The Facebook modules were inspired on the amazing work done by our colleagues from Qatar Computing Research Institute at HBKU, UNICEF, MIT Media Lab, iMMAP Colombia and the Global Protection Cluster from UNHCR, entitled <U+0093>Real-Time Monitoring of the Venezuelan Exodus through Facebook<U+0092>s Advertising Platform<U+0094> (see publication here).
C. Analyzing and visualizing web derived data
The analysis of web collected data is challenging because this data is frequently noisy and biased. We study how these challenges can be addressed by adequate modeling techniques. Additionally, visualizing as a means for extracting knowledge from data, is also fundamental when treating with web collected data.
We cover some basic cleaning procedures, different Machine Learning models and also static and interactive visualizations. Everything using the most popular Open Source libraries from Python Data-Science stack.
