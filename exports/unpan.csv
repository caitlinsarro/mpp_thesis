    The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted by UN Member States in 2015 affirms that “the spread of information and communication technology and global interconnectedness has great potential to accelerate human progress, to bridge the digital divide and to develop knowledge societies.” Women’s empowerment through E-Government can, indeed, accelerate the achievement of Goals and Targets across the 2030 Agenda. The new EGovforWomen Online Toolkit directly contributes to Sustainable Development Goals 5, 9, 10 and 16.

This online platform is an innovative public resource related to the design and implementation of gender-responsive E-government institutional ecosystems in the Asia-Pacific region. The toolkit represents the first region-wide toolbox to support the gender-mainstreaming of E-Government.  Through a set of 5 comprehensive modules, it provides key pointers for policymakers on gender-responsive design of e-service delivery, e-participation and connectivity initiatives, and introduces a capabilities-based approach to outcome evaluation of e-government for women’s empowerment.

Gender, governance and e-government
	Gender-responsive e-service delivery
	Gender-responsive e-participation
	Gender-responsive connectivity architecture
	Assessing gender-responsiveness of e-government ecosystems
Each module is oriented towards a clearly identified target group, and is geared towards the attainment of specific learning outcomes. Therefore, all modules have clearly delineated sub-units to enable step-by-step learning and exercises/ assignments to test knowledge attainments (including a case study, food for thought, group assignments and quizzes). Content of the modules is drawn from the regional research on e-government for women’s empowerment in Asia and the Pacific conducted by UNESCAP and IT for Change in 2015-16; as well as a scan of open source documentation of good practices in gender and e-government in the region, and in other contexts.

In the implementation of this project, ESCAP has partnered with IT for Change, India (www.ITforChange.net). IT for Change is a not-for-profit organisation that seeks to build a socially just and gender-equitable information society for the global South. Towards this, it is engaged in policy research, advocacy and field practice in the domains of gender, digital technologies and development; ICTs in education; e-government; Internet governance, digital rights; and data for development. At IT for Change, this project was led by Anita Gurumurthy, Executive Director with support from Nandini Chami, Senior Research Associate.

This project has been made possible with the generous funding from the Government of the Republic of Korea, through the Korea-ESCAP Cooperation Fund (KECF).

About us

The Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) serves as the United Nations’ regional hub promoting cooperation among countries to achieve inclusive and sustainable development. The largest regional intergovernmental platform with 53 member States and 9 associate members, ESCAP has emerged as a strong regional think-tank offering countries sound analytical products that shed insight into the evolving economic, social and environmental dynamics of the region. The Commission’s strategic focus is to deliver on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which it does by reinforcing and deepening regional cooperation and integration to advance connectivity, financial cooperation and market integration. ESCAP’s research and analysis coupled with its policy advisory services, capacity building and technical assistance to governments aims to support countries’ sustainable and inclusive development ambitions.

The United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA)  promotes and supports international cooperation in the pursuit of sustainable development for all. It addresses a range of cross-cutting issues that affect peoples’ lives and livelihoods, especially the most vulnerable. In providing a broad range of analytical products, policy advice and technical assistance, UN DESA effectively translates global commitments in the economic, social and environmental spheres into national policies and actions and plays a key role in monitoring progress towards the 17 Sustainable Development Goals.

                            , This Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) was developed by the Division for Sustainable Development Goals and the Division of Public Institutions and Digital Governance of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) and the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR). The objective of the self-paced e-learning course is to strengthen the capacity of National Stakeholders to design, adapt and implement integrated and coherent plans and policies and improved decision making among national stakeholders (policy makers, senior planners, civil society, academics and private sector) involved in recovery planning (i.e., Covid-19) and rebuilding towards SDGs implementation. , With its recovery focus and attention to advancing systems thinking and co-creation skills among national stakeholders, this e-learning course on ‘Integrated Recovery Planning and Policy Coherence Towards the SDGs’ serves as timely compliment to the growing suite of e-learning courses on integrated approaches across the UN system, such as the UN Sustainable Development Group’s ‘Primer on the SDGs’ hosted by the UN Staff System College, and its e-course on ‘Integrated Approaches to Mainstreaming, Acceleration and Policy Support for the SDGs’ hosted by UNICEF/UNDP. , The e-learning course builds on UNDESA and UNITAR's partnership throughout 2019 by jointly organizing regional workshops where many participating countries shared case studies and discussed challenges encountered in the formulation and implementation of integrated and coherent policy plans. It also builds on the implementation of UNDESA Development Account project “Implementation of national sustainable development strategies in selected countries in Africa and Latin America” that was implemented in three (3) representative countries in Costa Rica, Egypt and Ethiopia between 2016-2020., The overall objective of this project is to strengthen the capacity of Member States to design, adapt and implement Integrated and coherent policy plans and improved decision making among national stakeholders (policy makers, senior planners, civil society counterparts and academics) involved in COVID-19 recovery planning, rebuilding and SDGs implementation., Following the completion of the course, participants will be able to, Define key building blocks of an integrated recovery planning and policy coherence exercise towards transformational change in the SDGs, with particular emphasis on building back better in the wake of shocks such as the Covid-19 pandemic; , Map, analyze and engage effectively with key stakeholders in the national priority-setting process;  , Apply elements of systems thinking to assess and map intersectoral interactions, and identify nationally relevant ""leverage points"" (or ""accelerators"");  , Apply back-casting and scenario planning approaches to identify strategic policy options for achieving recovery objectives and for identifying robust policies and adaptive actions to ensure resilience to shocks;  , Provide examples of tools and methods used for integrated planning and policy coherence;  , Conduct institutional readiness assessment on institutional policy coherence against SDG requirements.  , The course consists of five modules:, Module 1. Introduction to Integrated Recovery Planning and Policy Coherence towards SDGs, Module 2. Mobilizing Stakeholders to Envision Success, Module 3. Systems Thinking to Understand Connections and Leverage Points, Module 4. Back-casting and Scenario Analysis to Identify Strategic Policy Options and Transformative Policy Pathways, Module 5. Coherent and Adaptive Implementation of Transformative Policy Pathways, This self-paced e-learning course is developed in English and consists of five modules. Each module is developed around the overall learning objectives, as well as second-level learning objectives specific to each module. The modules are supported by an objective multiple-choice quiz (summative assessment) that is conducted prior to taking the lesson (ex-ante) and after taking the lesson (ex-post). The former will not be graded and serves only to provide a baseline of the learner’s knowledge prior to taking the lesson. Net estimated study time for all modules is between 10-12 hours including all theory and assessments., The course is open to everyone. However, the main target audience of this self-paced e-learning course is senior policymakers from Planning Ministries, line ministries, civil society organizations, academia, and the private sector.","un"
