This course, <U+0093>Beyond the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): Addressing Sustainability and Development,<U+0094> is the first course in the Sustainability and Development MasterTrack<U+00AE> Certificate, but you can also take this course as a stand-alone learning opportunity. , Sustainability and development pose unprecedented challenges as human societies grow and seek to ensure future wellbeing and prosperity. In this course, we<U+0092>ll focus on addressing the twin challenges of sustainability and development with actionable knowledge for innovating solutions to the world<U+0092>s most pressing problems like climate change, poverty and inequality, and biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation. Rather than sustainability being a qualifier for development (e.g. sustainable development), we conceptualize Sustainability and Development as co-equal fields of inquiry and action that seek to build bridges between the natural, social and applied sciences and the humanities. When sustainability and development are placed on an equal footing, it requires us to think more explicitly about the trade-offs, co-benefits and synergies between them, which we will be exploring in depth in each week.

Throughout the course, you will be introduced to the theoretical currents in Sustainability and Development, and will garner an in-depth understanding of the United Nations<U+0092> 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We will also consider the methods and skills necessary for designing innovative solutions to sustainability and development problems through the emerging field of Sustainability Science.

In this course, we will explore three of the most pressing challenges undergirding the  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) including climate change, poverty and inequality, and ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss, with case studies to guide and challenge our thinking. In the final week of the course, we will discuss the trade-offs, co-benefits and synergies between these challenges, especially as they relate to designing innovative solutions for achieving  our sustainability and development goals.

By the end of this course, you will be able to:
1. Understand and explain the world<U+0092>s most pressing problems with a specific focus on poverty & inequality, ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss, and climate change.
2. Critically analyze the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and their relationship to the world<U+0092>s most pressing problems.
3. Use frameworks and evidence necessary to develop solutions.
4. Assess relevant solutions that would help realize the SDGs and at the same time solve the pressing problems.

"23",15,"Climate Adaptation in Africa","public university","This course explores why climate change adaptation is important in the African context. Africa is considered one to be one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change.   Historically, climate-related hazards such as drought, flooding, pest and disease outbreaks, coastal storms and heat waves have had devastating impacts on people and the environment in which they live. Often the damage knocks back progress that has been made in social and economic development, slowing down the achievement of development goals.  Climate models suggest that many of these climatic hazards will intensify as the global climate warms. Building resilience to climate risks, through adaptation, is critically important for future development in Africa., The course will examine adaptation in theory and in practice, through a focus on four sectors that are critically important for climate resilient development in Africa: Water Security, Agriculture and Food Security, Ecosystems and Ecosystem Services and Resilient Cities.","course explores climate change adaptation important african context africa considered one one vulnerable regions climate change historically climate related hazards drought flooding pest disease outbreaks coastal storms heat waves devastating impacts people environment live often damage knocks back progress made social economic development slowing achievement development goals climate models suggest many climatic hazards intensify global climate warms building resilience climate risks adaptation critically important future development africa course examine adaptation theory practice focus four sectors critically important climate resilient development africa water security agriculture food security ecosystems ecosystem services resilient cities","cours explor climat chang adapt import african context africa consid one one vulner region climat chang histor climat relat hazard drought flood pest diseas outbreak coastal storm heat wave devast impact peopl environ live often damag knock back progress made social econom develop slow achiev develop goal climat model suggest mani climat hazard intensifi global climat warm build resili climat risk adapt critic import futur develop africa cours examin adapt theori practic focus four sector critic import climat resili develop africa water secur agricultur food secur ecosystem ecosystem servic resili citi",12,0,2,0,5,"reflex_adpt_keystems"
"24",16,"Climate Change and Water in Mountains: A Global Concern","public university","What is climate change ? How are mountain regions affected by the evolution of water resources and their uses ? What kind of risks need to be considered ? , Mountains are recognized as particularly sensitive physical environments where intense and rapid changes have in the past, and may increasingly in the future, place pressure on their resource base. 

In this context, a team of roughly 100 experts worked from 2008 to 2013 for the European ACQWA project (www.acqwa.ch) which was coordinated by the University of Geneva. The primary objectives of the project were to assess the impacts of a changing climate on the quantity and quality of water originating in mountain regions, particularly where snow- and ice melt represent a large, sometimes the largest, streamflow component. A further objective of the project was to determine the potential disruptions to water-dependent economic activities related to the climate impacts on hydrological systems, and to propose a portfolio of possible adaptation strategies.

This particular MOOC is inspired by the ACQWA Project and offers a better understanding of climate change, its impacts on the quality and quantity of water in mountain regions and the risks related to changing water resources. From an interdisciplinary perspective, the participation of twenty-five instructors from five different countries (Switzerland, England, South Korea, India and Nepal) and fourteen institutions (UNIGE, RTS, UNIFR, UZH, ETHZ, Meteodat GmbH, WGMS, Imperial College London, Agroscope, R<e9>publique et Canton de Gen<e8>ve, Yonsei University, IHCAP, ICIMOD, SDC, FOEN) highlights the diversity of both theoretical and practical viewpoints related to these issues.

By the end of this course, you will be able :

- to define the general concept of climate change in mountain regions
- to understand the concepts associated with climate change such as adaptation and water governance strategies
- to consider the impacts of climate change on water resources in mountain regions

"25",17,"Climate Change Mitigation in Developing Countries","public university","This course challenges you to consider how one might lift societies out of poverty while also mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. We explore the inherent complexity of developing country governments wanting to grow their economies in a climate friendly way. You will be introduced to an approach with which to address this challenge. The approach consists of a facilitated process whereby academic researchers and high-level influential actors within society co-produce knowledge. You will track this process in four Latin American countries - Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Peru, and South Africa. You will hear from various professionals about their contexts and the different challenges and opportunities the process includes., This course will cover topics such as facilitation process techniques, energy modeling, scenario building, innovation and policy making. You will have the opportunity to respond to these topics with ideas and reflection from your own context. Whether you are a climate change practitioner, work in development or are simply curious about how climate mitigation is understood, this course will give you insights into the complexity of how countries from the South pursue development goals while addressing climate mitigation.

The course is free to enroll and take. You will be offered the option of purchasing a certificate of completion, which you become eligible for if you successfully complete the course requirements.

This MOOC is at the junction between the development of Southern countries and sustainable development. 
It has: 
1) a macroeconomic and financial dimension, developed by Gael Giraud and Alain Grandjean; 
2) an ecological and climatic dimension, developed by David Claessen and ENS speakers; and 
3) a focus on Southern countries, developed by AFD speakers.

Here are the learning goals for the entire training program:

Goal 1: Be able to understand the relationship between the energy transition, the ecological transition, the role of energy in our economy, our economic development model, and financing issues. 
Goal 2: Know how to advocate for and lobby on issues and on the need to change reality in order to implement strategies and action plans.
Goal 3: Be able to make a link between the Energy transition and financing solutions, and between comprehension and action.  
No one questions the imperative need to ensure development based on personal well-being and a fair distribution of wealth.

The Challenges of a Transition for All  
Until now the development of Northern countries has been based on an increasing exploitation of energy resources and a greater freedom of trade and exchange at the global scale. We now know that such a model is no longer sustainable, due to global warming and to the overexploitation of resources, which lead to health, social, and environmental disasters.

The Role of Developing Countries
With that in mind, how can we ensure fair and equitable growth for all? What role do countries from the different regions in the South have to play in this complete upheaval of the current economic, trade, and political models in order to achieve an effective energy and ecological transition?
  
A MOOC to Respond to these Questions
This free online training offers complementary perspectives from several specialists of issues related to climate change and the development of Southern countries. They will share their very practical understanding of the current crises and the answers that can be provided. Participants will learn from studies by:
<U+0095> Researchers from the prestigious <c9>cole Normale Sup<e9>rieure in Paris
<U+0095> Field experts from the Agence Fran<e7>aise de D<e9>veloppement, a funding agency that has been committed to helping developing countries for 75 years,

"52",35,"From Climate Science to Action","government","Each part of the world faces specific vulnerabilities to climate change and has different opportunities to mitigate the effects and build resilience in the 21st century. With the ratification of the Paris Agreement, many countries have acceded to act in combatting climate change. Indeed, without climate action, decades of sustainable development is at risk, thus making this a <U+0091>make or break<U+0092> point in time. Showcasing the most recent scientific evidence, explaining the different regional impacts and divulging climate action strategies, along with interactive tools such as a Carbon Footprint Tracker and (I) NDC Platform, this MOOC provides some opportunities, where you can take action on climate change., About the Course

This action-oriented MOOC gives you the opportunity to learn about regional climate change impacts and sector-specific strategies to increase resilience and move towards a low-carbon future. You will have the opportunity to explore these issues in depth and tailor your learning experience for one or more of the following regions:

<U+0095>  Latin America and Caribbean
<U+0095>  Sub-Saharan Africa
<U+0095>  Middle East and North Africa
<U+0095>  Eastern Europe and Central Asia
<U+0095>  East Asia and Pacific
<U+0095>  South Asia

 In this endeavor, the MOOC brings together renowned scientists and policymakers to provide a synthesis of the most recent scientific evidence on climate change, regional low emissions and climate resilient development strategies across sectors. A team of expert Instructors will lead discussions around the Paris Agreement, reflections from COP22 and the progress on Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).

Course Syllabus

Overview 

<U+0091>From Climate Science to Action<U+0092> is divided into four weeks. The first two weeks will provide a comprehensive overview of the scientific evidence for climate change, followed by region-specific insights on the impacts of a warmer world in the 21st century. The last two weeks will focus on action strategies that are being undertaken in different regions and countries to meet the climate challenge, and how you as an individual can take action to avoid a warmer world!

Week 1:  Climate Change in the 21st Century

<U+0095>  Historical and projected observed changes in the climate system, leading up to the end of the 21st century
<U+0095>  The potential of Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) submitted at COP 21 from 187 countries to induce climate action
<U+0095>  Trends in climate change impacts, including loss of Arctic sea ice, melting glaciers, increased heat waves and extreme temperatures, and drought and aridity 
<U+0095>  Possible responses from natural systems, explaining how warming could result in sea-level rise, heat waves and extreme temperatures, and ocean acidification

Week 2: Sectoral and Regional Impacts

<U+0095>  Impacts on key development sectors<U+0097>from warming above pre-industrial temperatures and projected climate trends<U+0097>across each of the world<U+0092>s regions
<U+0095>  Sectoral impacts focusing on agricultural production, water resources, ecosystem services, and coastal vulnerability for affected populations 
<U+0095>  Importance of risks with the potential to reverse hard-won development gains and potentially trap millions in poverty, illustrating the need for urgent action now

Week 3: From Science to Action on Climate Change

<U+0095>  Region-specific discussions on mitigation actions needed to reduce emissions while decreasing vulnerability to climate change impacts through adaptation and by building climate resilience
<U+0095>  Perspectives from regional experts on their experiences in strategies and actions proposed in each region to help transition towards a low-emissions, climate-resilient development path 
<U+0095>  Discussions on the progress of the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), outcomes of the Paris Agreement and reflections from the Conference of Parties (COP)22

Week 4: What You Can Do

<U+0095>  Transformative impact of day-to-day changes when brought to a global scale
<U+0095>  The rationale for acting now, acting together and acting differently
<U+0095>  Examples and expected benefits of mitigation and adaptation policies, considering both contributions to global emission reductions and local development opportunities

The course kicks off with content around Arctic geography, climate, and exploration history, and then walks learners through the basics of the components of the Arctic system: atmosphere, ocean, sea ice and ecosystems. You will also learn how the data collected during MOSAiC will be used to improve climate model projections.

We will learn why the Arctic is cold and ice covered, and how that impacts its climate and ecosystems. We will also consider how the Arctic is connected to the rest of the world. Finally, we will examine present day climate change, the processes driving it, and evidence for it in the Arctic, before looking at the implications in the rapidly evolving North.

Communities around the world are transmitting their living heritage, which gives meaning to their lives, strengthens resilience, and contributes to their well-being. In this way intangible cultural heritage and sustainable development are closely linked. The international community made a commitment to safeguarding living heritage when it adopted the Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2003 and it set itself ambitious goals by adopting the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This course helps to understand the connections between the two., By taking this course students and other interested learners and professionals will gain a better understanding of intangible cultural heritage and its relationships with sustainable development, exploring examples and experiences of communities from around the world., This MOOC was developed by UNESCO in collaboration with the International Information and Networking Centre in Asia and the Pacific under the auspices of UNESCO (ICHCAP) and the SDG Academy. It brings together a diverse group of lead experts in the field of intangible cultural heritage and development who collaborated closely with the UNESCO Chair for Research on Intangible Cultural Heritage and Cultural Diversity of the National Autonomous University of Mexico as lead faculty to develop the content of this course. The course draws on their longstanding expertise, the experiences of communities engaged in transmitting their living heritage and ten years of implementing UNESCO<U+0092>s global capacity building

"138",89,"Planning for Climate Change in African Cities","public university","Climate change poses a threat to economic growth and long-term prosperity of many countries around the world. Africa is not an exception, considering the actual and potential impacts of climate change and climate variability that will threaten its vulnerable sectors and human populations. African countries are projected to experience changing rainfall patterns, rising sea levels, and higher temperatures that will affect food security, agricultural production, water availability, and public health, among others. These climate change impacts and climate variability can further produce social and political problems, such as rural-urban migration and water resource disputes.   , Furthermore, the low levels of development in many African countries, as well as limited institutional, infrastructural, and technical capacities to respond successfully to climate change impacts and climate variability, can exacerbate the situation. In terms of contribution to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, although African countries are the lightest polluters, it has also become apparent that alternative energy sources can offset the increasing energy demand and dependence on biomass. Addressing climate change offers possibilities for low-carbon development. Moreover, there are promising mechanisms that can address both climate change actions and development goals simultaneously. 

At the city level, strengthening resilience, or the ability to respond to and absorb the effects of a hazardous event in a timely and efficient manner and to sustain this ability in the future, and adaptation; the process of adjusting to actual or expected climate change stimuli or their effects, should be at the forefront of planning.  Local governments have an important role to play through the provision of adequate infrastructure, regulation of land use, and other public services that are crucial for urban resilience. Mobilizing local governments, in collaboration with national governments, non-governmental organizations, and international organizations, among others, is also critical for an integrated multi-sectoral approach to climate change. 

The Course on Planning for Climate Change in African Cities provides the foundation for understanding cities<U+0092> exposure and sensitivity to climate change, and how cities can manage these impacts in the face of growing uncertainty. It does so by introducing the basic concepts of urban resilience and adaptation, by using illustrative case studies in different African cities. Furthermore, this module provides lectures on the different approaches for climate change planning, whether ad hoc, strategic or mainstreaming; introduces the different steps in the planning cycle <U+0096> from initial assessment to monitoring and evaluation; and presents the different decision support and assessment tools for prioritizing climate change actions. This course broadens the discussion on planning for climate change by engaging learners to apply their knowledge and practice their decision-making skills in a simulated exercise.

In line with development that minimizes the harm caused by climate change impacts, while maximizing the many human development opportunities presented by a more resilient future, we ask: what are the connections between urban risk and vulnerability? How is climate change and urban resilience conceptualized and applied in practice? Which policies and measures should be introduced to address climate change? Finally, how to choose among different measures that address climate change adaptation, urban resilience, and other development objectives? 

Course Objectives:
At the end of this course, learners should be able to:

<U+0095>	Recognize the effects, impacts, and drivers of climate change in cities

"139",89,"Planning for Climate Change in African Cities","government","Climate change poses a threat to economic growth and long-term prosperity of many countries around the world. Africa is not an exception, considering the actual and potential impacts of climate change and climate variability that will threaten its vulnerable sectors and human populations. African countries are projected to experience changing rainfall patterns, rising sea levels, and higher temperatures that will affect food security, agricultural production, water availability, and public health, among others. These climate change impacts and climate variability can further produce social and political problems, such as rural-urban migration and water resource disputes.   , Furthermore, the low levels of development in many African countries, as well as limited institutional, infrastructural, and technical capacities to respond successfully to climate change impacts and climate variability, can exacerbate the situation. In terms of contribution to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, although African countries are the lightest polluters, it has also become apparent that alternative energy sources can offset the increasing energy demand and dependence on biomass. Addressing climate change offers possibilities for low-carbon development. Moreover, there are promising mechanisms that can address both climate change actions and development goals simultaneously. 

At the city level, strengthening resilience, or the ability to respond to and absorb the effects of a hazardous event in a timely and efficient manner and to sustain this ability in the future, and adaptation; the process of adjusting to actual or expected climate change stimuli or their effects, should be at the forefront of planning.  Local governments have an important role to play through the provision of adequate infrastructure, regulation of land use, and other public services that are crucial for urban resilience. Mobilizing local governments, in collaboration with national governments, non-governmental organizations, and international organizations, among others, is also critical for an integrated multi-sectoral approach to climate change. 

The Course on Planning for Climate Change in African Cities provides the foundation for understanding cities<U+0092> exposure and sensitivity to climate change, and how cities can manage these impacts in the face of growing uncertainty. It does so by introducing the basic concepts of urban resilience and adaptation, by using illustrative case studies in different African cities. Furthermore, this module provides lectures on the different approaches for climate change planning, whether ad hoc, strategic or mainstreaming; introduces the different steps in the planning cycle <U+0096> from initial assessment to monitoring and evaluation; and presents the different decision support and assessment tools for prioritizing climate change actions. This course broadens the discussion on planning for climate change by engaging learners to apply their knowledge and practice their decision-making skills in a simulated exercise.

In line with development that minimizes the harm caused by climate change impacts, while maximizing the many human development opportunities presented by a more resilient future, we ask: what are the connections between urban risk and vulnerability? How is climate change and urban resilience conceptualized and applied in practice? Which policies and measures should be introduced to address climate change? Finally, how to choose among different measures that address climate change adaptation, urban resilience, and other development objectives?

This course explores social protection as it applies to sustainable development, the 2030 Agenda, and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
Social protection is a key element of national strategies to promote human development, political stability, and inclusive growth. Currently, an estimated 53 per cent of the world<U+0092>s population lives without any form of social protection.

The ambitious objectives set out in the 2030 Agenda and the unprecedented social protection requirements related to COVID-19 will involve concerted efforts from across the spectrum of UN and national actors, linking interventions and leveraging new tools to build universal social protection programmes and achieve the 2030 Agenda promise of life in dignity and prosperity on a healthy planet.
This course will prepare participants to do just that, by focusing on the <U+0093>what<U+0094>, <U+0093>why<U+0094>, and <U+0093>how<U+0094> of social protection principles in order to prepare them to work among social protection experts, advocates, and beneficiaries.

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is unprecedented in its scope and ambition. The UN and governments have neither the reach nor the resources to implement it alone. Engagement, especially with the private sector, is imperative for the 2030 Agenda to succeed.
The private sector with its unparalleled reach has the capacity to be a key driver to achieve the objectives of the 2030 Agenda and in some cases is already performing this role. The UN and its member states must seize the opportunity to form strategic partnerships with private sector entities and advocate for businesses to embrace sustainable development in order to achieve the 2030 Agenda.
Moreover, the 2030 Agenda offers the private sector numerous opportunities to access new markets and institutional investment, estimated at about $12 trillion by 2030 while adding 380 million new jobs. This in itself is a compelling argument for the private sector and governments to work together to make the 2030 Agenda a reality.

In fact, in some places, the increased productivity and rising profits associated with automation have directly impacted the availability of decent jobs. According to the International Labour Organization, more than 204 million people were unemployed in 2015, and more than 600 million new jobs are needed by 2030 just to keep pace with the growth of the working-age population. We also need to improve working conditions for the 780 million women and men who are employed but not earning enough to lift themselves and their families out of poverty. In addressing these core issues we will not only see increasing decent work opportunities but also more robust, inclusive and poverty-reducing growth., This course explores the past and future of work in the context of the SDGs, particularly SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth. It examines the state of income and employment around the world, barriers to employment, policies to promote economic opportunity, and the future of work in our rapidly changing world. Encouraging entrepreneurship and job creation are key to achieving the SDGs, as are effective measures to eradicate forced labor, slavery, and human trafficking.
