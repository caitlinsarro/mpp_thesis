You ll also learn health s positive influence on other sectors, with investments in health shown to have a positive impact on economic development. This course will illuminate how health impacts and is essential to achieving poverty reduction, gender empowerment, universal education, conflict resolution and other Sustainable Development Goals., Graduate students and advanced undergraduate students studying public health, international development, public policy, nursing and medicine and other fields who are interested in the key concepts and practices in global public health, Healthcare professionals and other practitioners who want to understand their work within the broader context of international policy and the concept of sustainable
