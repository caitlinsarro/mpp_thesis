The purpose of this course is to share the latest knowledge and approaches to measuring and managing plastic pollution from land-based sources, in particular cities, for the achievement of local, national and regional goals related to sustainable development.
ABSTRACT
Plastic pollution is entering our oceans at an alarming rate, damaging our marine environments and endangering local livelihoods. The Asia-Pacific is an important centre of innovation for plastic waste management and a hotspot for pollution. Across the region, cities and city governments are at the frontier of global efforts to stop plastic waste entering the environment. 
This course was developed for the Closing the Loop project by UN ESCAP in partnership with the Government of Japan. Closing the Loop aims to reduce the environmental impact of cities in ASEAN by addressing plastic waste pollution in the marine environment. In support of the ASEAN Framework of Action on Marine Debris and the G20 Osaka Blue Ocean Vision, the project will bring a more circular approach to plastic waste management and reduce the amount of waste entering the marine environment.
This course was developed to facilitate local government capacity building on the topic of marine plastic waste. Course development was led by UN ESCAP in collaboration with Ocean Conservancy, UN Environment Programme (UNEP), the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES), Women in Informal Employment: Globalizing and Organizing (WIEGO), Coordinating Body on the Seas of East Asia (COBSEA), Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), the International Solid Waste Association (ISWA), Plymouth Marine Lab, Wageningen University & Research, Keio University and the University of Leeds.

With its recovery focus and attention to advancing systems thinking and co-creation skills among national stakeholders, this e-learning course on <U+0091>Integrated Recovery Planning and Policy Coherence Towards the SDGs<U+0092> serves as timely compliment to the growing suite of e-learning courses on integrated approaches across the UN system, such as the UN Sustainable Development Group<U+0092>s <U+0091>Primer on the SDGs<U+0092> hosted by the UN Staff System College, and its e-course on <U+0091>Integrated Approaches to Mainstreaming, Acceleration and Policy Support for the SDGs<U+0092> hosted by UNICEF/UNDP.
The e-learning course builds on UNDESA and UNITAR<U+0092>s partnership throughout 2019 by jointly organizing regional workshops where many participating countries shared case studies and discussed challenges encountered in the formulation and implementation of integrated and coherent policy plans. It also builds on the implementation of UNDESA Development Account project <U+0093>Implementation of national sustainable development strategies in selected countries in Africa and Latin America<U+0094> that was implemented in three (3) representative countries in Costa Rica, Egypt and Ethiopia between 2016-2020.
The course consists of five modules:
Module 1. Introduction to Integrated Recovery Planning and Policy Coherence towards SDGs
Module 2. Mobilizing Stakeholders to Envision Success

As of August 2017, 152 Parties to the Convention out of 197 have submitted their first Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to the UNFCCC, with 102 including an adaptation component, the majority being developing countries. The UNFCCC report released in October 2016 on progress in the process of formulating and implementing National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) indicates that many more countries, including over 80% of Least Developed Countries (LDCs), have embarked on developing a NAP.
The development and implementation of NAPs involve decisions related to climate risk management, which require reliable, relevant, usable and timely climate information.
Climate information used within the NAP process encompasses a wide range of information on past, present and future climate, and products which help improve the understanding of climate and its impacts on natural and human systems and support decisions to improve climate-related outcomes. Climate services involve the production, translation, transfer and use of climate knowledge and information for this purpose. Climate services, therefore, play a crucial role in the planning, financing and implementation of adaptation to climate change.
In this context and drawing on the WMO-led Global Framework for Climate Services (GFCS), WMO and UNITAR developed capacity building e-learning materials in support of a wider training package on <U+0093>Integration Climate Risk Information into National Adaptation Planning<U+0094>. The aim of this e-learning component is to contribute to capacity building that will bridge the information and communication gaps currently affecting the demand for climate information services and their supply.

The course is designed to respond the learning needs of both climate services providers (National Hydro-meteorological Services, research/academic and international organizations), and users (e.g. decision makers, private investors, non-governmental organizations, etc.), as well as of those working at the science-policy interface for outreach or communication purposes.
The training is modular<U+00A0> and provides you with the liberty to<U+00A0> choose and combine different thematic modules. There are two main themes or learning tracks available as illustrated in the figure below.
Learning track 1 (green-colored): Producing climate information for NAPs
Learning track 2 (yellow-colored):<U+00A0>Using climate information for NAPs
Both learning tracks have in common the Intro and Wrap-up modules.
How to choose the learning track that best suits your profile and learning needs?
Once you complete the Intro module, you are recommended to undertake a test. Based on your answers to the five questions of the test you will be advised to follow either learning track 1 or 2, or both.
Each learning track culminates with a quiz that will assess the knowledge you will acquire. If you pass the quiz with a minimum mark of 70%, a certificate of completion will be issued to you. If you choose to follow both learning tracks you can receive two certificates by passing both quizzes.

The course is based on materials developed over the course of several years for the delivery of face-to-face RBF learning events, which generated a rich repository of knowledge. That knowledge has been translated into e-learning modules to reach a critical mass of health practitioners globally. The course aims to equip participants with specific knowledge to help determine whether RBF is an appropriate tool for their context and if so, what type of RBF approach may be appropriate to adopt.
The e-learning course is supported by funding from the Health Results Innovation Trust Fund (HRITF). Since 2007, HRITF has been pioneering RBF programs, with a particular focus on improving maternal and child health outcomes to accelerate progress towards Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 1c, 4 and 5.

Course context
Traditionally, government and donor funds to improve health service delivery have concentrated on increasing critical inputs, such as infrastructure, equipment, supplies, drugs and vaccines. Since the adoption of the Millennium Declaration in 2000, this development assistance for health has more than doubled. And yet the increase in investments has not translated into the expected health outcomes in low and middle income countries. The challenge these countries face is unequal access and utilization of essential health services, often due to low quality of services, inefficient delivery of services and limited management capacity. In addition, poor households in many countries face impoverishment due to limited financial protection in the health system. Consequently, many countries, especially those in Africa, risk not achieving the MDGs for maternal and child health by 2015.
As a result, many governments and development agencies have been motivated to try new innovations and approaches that can boost health system functioning. RBF is one approach that is gaining momentum with country governments and development partners. RBF links financing to pre-determined results such as the actual use of health services, as well as their quality, and as opposed to financing inputs such as medical equipment or supplies. The experience so far shows promising results, especially in terms of increased utilization of key maternal and child health services. In addition, RBF is seen as a way to strengthen core health systems, making them more accountable and efficient by delivering greater value for money.
A vital aspect for any successful RBF approach is ensuring the appropriateness of the strategy for a particular context, which is at the core of this e-learning course. The World Bank Group and its partners has undertaken many capacity building engagements on RBF, including:
Consultations with key stakeholders.
Study tours from countries considering or starting RBF to those already implementing them.
Knowledge and lessons-sharing events.
Technical training workshops for policy makers and other stakeholders.
Peer-to-peer exchange forums.
These programs are geared at informed decision-making on the appropriateness of RBF and building implementation capacity to mitigate the risk of failure in implementing RBF mechanisms. This e-learning platform is designed to complement these initiatives, and to: equip participants with the tools to decide whether RBF may be an appropriate policy option to consider in addressing health system challenges; and to be able to apply RBF design and implementation concepts/principles.
The objectives of the course are to:
Provide background knowledge on RBF and its different approaches.
Introduce core principles of RBF for health.
Provide some country examples of RBF for health in practice.

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is unprecedented in its scope and ambition. The UN and governments have neither the reach nor the resources to implement it alone. Engagement, especially with the private sector, is imperative for the 2030 Agenda to succeed.
The private sector with its unparalleled reach has the capacity to be a key driver to achieve the objectives of the 2030 Agenda and in some cases is already performing this role. The UN and its member states must seize the opportunity to form strategic partnerships with private sector entities and advocate for businesses to embrace sustainable development in order to achieve the 2030 Agenda.

This in itself is a compelling argument for the private sector and governments to work together to make the 2030 Agenda a reality.

The measurement of productivity is an important element in the evaluation of the relative efficiency of factor utilization domestically and internationally. The analysis of trends in productivity, especially labor productivity, is a factor in the successful examination of occupational mobility, the projection of future employment opportunities, and the determination of future workforce and training policies.
The seminar includes discussions on the following topics:
Definitions and concepts
Output, inputs, prices and costs, index theory, and aggregation methods
Methodology for calculating output per hour and multifactor productivity measures
Output measurement including deflated value and physical quantity measures, input measurement, aggregation of heterogeneous outputs and inputs, index construction, and index linking
Sources of data
Various government and private sources (including discussion of poor or fragmentary data) for derivation of: output measures, input measures (including labor, capital, and intermediate purchases), and weights
Trend analysis
Changes in productivity, factor input shifts, and historical analysis
Data used to construct productivity measures are also used to report on the following SDG indicators:
Indicator 8.2.1: Annual growth rate of real GDP per employed person
Indicator 9.2.2: Manufacturing employment as a proportion of total employment
, Productivity is one of the major determinants of the standard of living, since increases in productivity may result in higher real income and promote price stability. The measurement of productivity is an important element in the evaluation of the relative efficiency of factor utilization domestically and internationally. The analysis of trends in productivity, especially labor productivity, is a factor in the successful examination of occupational mobility, the projection of future employment opportunities, and the determination of future workforce and training policies., The seminar includes discussions on the following topics:, Definitions and concepts, Methodology for calculating output per hour and multifactor productivity measures, Sources of data, Trend analysis, Data used to construct productivity measures are also used to report on the following SDG indicators:,

Unfortunately, most of these deaths are now occurring in the developing world. The World Bank is moving to address this major public health challenge through its Environmental Health and Pollution Management business line with the launch of the<U+00A0>Pollution Management and Environmental Health<U+00A0>(PMEH)<U+00A0>multi-donor trust fund, through pilot programs to demonstrate how to improve air quality in specific cities, through research to improve our understanding of where air pollution is most prevalent and through learning products such as this online e-learning course.
This<U+00A0>Air Quality Management series of courses has been created for development professionals, government officials, and other partners who want to learn about the fundamentals of air quality management planning. Successful air quality management programs can reduce emissions that lead to air pollution while simultaneously providing other development benefits that accrue locally as well as globally. Benefits can include improved public health, energy savings, economic development, agricultural benefits, and reduced emissions of greenhouse gases and other short-lived climate pollution. We hope this introductory course provides the foundation for establishing such a program in your community and that follow-up courses will provide skills and information on how to monitor air pollution and increase public awareness, how to develop emission inventories and track progress, how to assess the benefits of air quality improvement, how to select control strategies that are most effective and finally these courses will share information on the importance of stakeholder engagement and describe regulatory approaches that have been most effective elsewhere.
Designing and implementing an effective Air Quality Management (AQM) program relies on a complete understanding of the specific issues affecting a given region, requiring awareness raising, data collection and capacity building. This course provides a basic introduction to concepts of air pollution and its management.

Designed as an in-career programme, MACD has a compact structure and covers two disciplines, namely, anti-corruption and diplomacy. The programme offers a series of interdisciplinary modules which concentrate on concepts and practical tools for preventing and countering corruption, and diplomacy.
The programme includes subjects and cross-cutting themes relating to economics, behavioural science, ethics, law, compliance, diplomacy, international law, digital and cyber diplomacy, as well as essential skills for an international career such as negotiations, leadership, effective writing, public speaking and stakeholder coordination & engagement. The programme utilizes lectures, case studies, interactive sessions, group work, and stakeholder discussions to identify best practices in anti-corruption and diplomacy. MACD modules are complemented by expert talks on anti-corruption and diplomacy topics. Programme delivery is campus-based and virtual live interaction, with the first module taking place at the UNITAR Headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland, ensuring effective knowledge transfer and the immediate applicability of the knowledge and skills acquired. The programme is completed with the successful submission and defence of a master<U+0092>s thesis for which a supporting course in research methods is incorporated into the modules. The master<U+0092>s thesis defence in this programme will take place online. Upon successful completin of the master<U+0092>s thesis defence, the graduates will visit IACA<U+0092>s campus in Laxenburg, Austria, and attend their graduation ceremony, organized by IACA.

The course is based on the UN publication <U+0093>Managing Infrastructure Assets for Sustainable Development: A Handbook for Local and National Governments<U+0094> <U+0096> the result of a joint collaboration of UN DESA, UNCDF and UNOPS.
The Handbook includes inputs from renowned experts from regional development banks, local government associations, relevant UN system entities as well as think tanks and academia. The Handbook provides local and national governments with a set of practical tools to improve infrastructure asset management as well as guidance on how to adapt these tools to the socio-economic and environmental challenges of our time.
It addresses a set of key questions:
What assets do people need?
How can these assets be made to last the longest and perform the best?
How can their potential to save or generate revenue be maximized so as to unlock financial resources for other community needs, now and in the future?
In the answers to these questions lies the key to ensuring the reliability of public infrastructure and services at all levels.
This e-learning course aims to equip policymakers and government officials to find the answers in their specific national and local contexts.<U+00A0> It makes a compelling case that ultimately, asset management is a way to align strategic planning with infrastructure and service delivery in the real world. It will equip the learner with a rich set of tools to promote sound, forward-looking asset management that enhances the resilience, sustainability, reliability, and financial viability of infrastructure investments for present and future generations.
The course is divided into two parts: Fundamentals: Infrastructure Asset Management for Sustainable Development (Module 1-4) and InFocus: Infrastructure Asset Management for Sustainable Development (Module 5-8).
Fundamentals:
Module 1. Basic tenets of asset management
Module 2. The dynamics of asset management
Module 3. Assessing asset management needs and capacity
Module 4. Asset Management Action Plans (AMAPs)
In Focus:
Module 5. Capturing and utilising the right data for effective asset management
