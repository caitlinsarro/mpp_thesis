","_The SEEA EEA constitutes an integrated statistical framework for organizing biophysical data, measuring ecosystem services, tracking changes in ecosystem assets and linking this information to economic and other human activity. The SEEA EEA complements the SEEA Central Framework by taking a different perspective. The Central Framework looks at “individual environmental assets”, such as water resources, energy resources, etc. and how those assets move between the environment and the economy. In contrast, the SEEA EEA takes the perspective of ecosystems and considers how individual environmental assets interact as part of natural processes within a given spatial area. Ecosystem accounting takes a spatial approach, often utilizing earth observation and geospatial data. Using this spatial approach, the SEEA EEA accounts for the extent and condition of ecosystems, the flow of services provided by ecosystems and the contributions and benefits of ecosystems to economic and other human activity.
This course provides an overview of the SEEA EEA, including how the SEEA EEA can be used for policy. The course covers ecosystem extent, condition and service accounts as well as accounting for biodiversity, water and carbon.
The course is self-paced without instruction and can be taken at any point in time.

","_The e-learning course on the Integration of the SDGs into National Planning was developed by UN ESCAP to support policy makers and sustainable development practitioners in development of strategies and plans to implement the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development and the SDGs.
The complex and aspirational 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), require multidisciplinary methods for developing implementation strategies because of their “indivisible whole” nature. Furthermore, the 17 Sustainable Development Goals and their targets are closely interlinked and require innovative and unconventional policy approaches, such as those focusing on the intersections (meeting points), interlinkages and complex causal relationships. This e-Learning course deals with the aspects of ’Why’ and ‘How’ of integration and ESCAP methodologies and tools to aid integrated and interlinked policy making process.
The course consists of three modules, which give insights on the importance of the integration of the three dimensions of sustainable development, and provide further guidance on available tools and their application for policy making and implementation.
The first module on Integration of the Three Dimensions of Sustainable Development is based on the UN ESCAP publication with correlating title – Integrating the three dimensions of sustainable development: A framework and tools. The module defines and articulates to policy makers the essence of integration of the three dimensions of sustainable developmentnamely economic, social and environmental, across the policy cycle.
The second module on Systems Thinking Framework to Support the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development and the SDGs provides an overview of systems thinking methodology and school of thought, a step-by-step guide to systems thinking modelling and examples of application in countries of the Asia-Pacific region. The module also briefly introduces the ESCAP experience in applying systems thinking to SDG integration analysis and provides examples and case studies from contributing partners.
The third module on ESCAP’s Methodology for Applying Systems Thinking in Asia-Pacific Countries for Integrating SDG 6 into National Planning describes the practical application of the ESCAP analytical framework for integration of SDG 6 on Clean Water and Sanitation with the other 16 SDGs at the target level and builds on the Analytical Framework for Integration of Water and Sanitation SDGs and Targets Using Systems Thinking Approach. The module also describes the practical application of the methodology in pilot countries and lessons learned.

","_The System of Environmental-Economic Accounts for Water (SEEA-Water) is an integrated approach to water monitoring, bringing together a wide range of water related statistics across sectors into one coherent information system. The SEEA-Water is the conceptual framework and set of accounts which presents hydrological information alongside economic information in a consistent way. The SEEA-Water is consistent with the SEEA Central Framework and follows a similar accounting structure to the System of National Accounts (SNA). The SEEA-Water uses concepts, definitions and classifications consistent with the SNA in order to facilitate the integration of environmental and economic statistics. By doing so, the SEEA-Water allows us to develop indicators and conduct analysis on the economy-environment nexus, with a focus on water.
The SEEA-Water facilitates better informed decision-making, particularly for integrated water resources management. The SEEA-Water offers a means of monitoring pressures exerted by the economy on the environment, in terms of abstraction of water from the environment; impacts in terms of changes in stocks of water; and how the economy responds in terms of expenditure on environmental protection and resource management. The SEEA-Water does not propose particular indicators, but is instead a holistic multi-purpose information system that can generate a wide range of statistics and indicators with varying potential analytical applications. For example, Goal 6 of the SDGs focuses specifically on water and includes calls for improving water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping and the release of hazardous materials, reducing the proportion of untreated wastewater and increasing recycling and safe reuse of water. The SEEA-Water methodology can play an important role in measuring these targets by providing a framework for the development of indicators.
The course is self-paced without instruction and can be taken at any point in time.

									, The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Goals (SDGs) call for collaboration and partnership like never before. Achieving the SDGs requires us to look at complex global challenges through many different dimensions. The SDG Lab was created to do just that — by acting as a connector, amplifier, question asker and innovator. This toolkit is a living document that captures the Lab’s journey by providing insight into the methods, tools and techniques that, if used, can enable you or your organization to deliver on the Agenda. The toolkit can be used as the foundation for your own lab or to inspire new ways of working, it can help you in:, 
					Target audience
					This toolkit can be used by a range of audiences. It was built to help those who are considering starting a Lab or a similar multi-stakeholder, experimental initiative, but it is equally useful for those who are looking for new methods and ideas.
It is relevant to all stakeholder groups (UN, NGO, government, academic institutions and the private sector), particularly when they are assuming the role of a convener, facilitator, incubator, or change maker.

","_The System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA) 2012—Central Framework is a multipurpose conceptual framework for measuring the interactions between the environment and the economy. By providing an internationally agreed standard with agreed concepts, definitions and classifications, the SEEA is an invaluable tool for compiling integrated statistics on the economy and the environment. The SEEA framework follows a similar accounting structure to the System of National Accounts (SNA). The SEEA uses concepts, definitions and classifications consistent with the SNA in order to facilitate the integration of environmental and economic statistics. By doing so, the SEEA allows us to develop indicators and conduct analysis on the economy-environment nexus.
The SEEA facilitates better informed decision-making. The SEEA Central Framework offers a means of monitoring pressures exerted by the economy on the environment, in terms of abstraction of natural resources and emissions; impacts in terms of changes in stocks of natural resources; and how the economy responds in terms of expenditure on environmental protection and resource management. The SEEA does not propose particular indicators, but is instead a holistic multi-purpose information system that can generate a wide range of statistics and indicators with varying potential analytical applications.
The course is self-paced without instruction and can be taken at any point in time.

","_The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) lay out a set of key development objectives for developed and developing countries alike to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all.
Among the priorities agreed upon by member states is social protection — cited in the agenda as a primary means to protect all individuals and families against social contingencies and market risks across the life-cycle. Countries are called on to “implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors, and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable.”
Currently, an estimated 69.4 per cent of the world’s population lives without adequate social protection coverage, including lack of access to a pension, unemployment benefits, health insurance, and income guarantees.
According to the International Labour Organization, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has simultaneously, “exposed deep-seated inequalities and significant gaps in social protection coverage, comprehensiveness and adequacy across all countries” and, “provoked an unparalleled social protection policy response”. It is therefore time to accelerate the transformation of social protection systems in light of the pandemic, to ensure human-centred recovery and resilience.
The ambitious objectives of the 2030 Agenda and the newfound drive for building comprehensive social protection systems will require concerted efforts from across the spectrum of UN and national actors, joining up disparate interventions and leveraging new tools to build enhanced social protection programmes and achieve the 2030 target.

","_We are all called to lead, to act, to change. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development represents an imperative for change for the United Nations. The Covid-19 pandemic has drastically underlined the connections between immediate public health measures and wider economic, social and environmental linkages, which need to be considered when designing and implementing integrated responses. Yet, the efforts to build back better risk favouring unsustainable short-term gains, which will ultimately increase inequality and threaten the planet, over a push toward the needed long-term transformation toward human well-being within planetary boundaries.
The course aims at supporting UN leaders to articulate, facilitate and broker the needed changes in support of the people in the countries they serve. It also provides a space to discuss the necessary adjustments in the structure, leadership, accountability mechanisms, interaction and capacities of the UN development system, which are required to ensure it is positioned to provide countries with the support they need, while strengthening its relevance. The UN needs visionary and principled leadership across the system to address today’s challenging world. It needs leaders who stand up for UN values— and who inspire through their commitment to peace, justice, respect, human rights, tolerance, and solidarity.
Participants will deepen their knowledge and sharpen their political acumen through engaging discussions with UN senior officials and subject matter experts. There will be opportunities to share practices through interactive peer-to-peer learning and workshops that unpack inter-agency concerns as well as individual agency contexts and develop solutions that leverage each UN agency’s strengths and expertise.
