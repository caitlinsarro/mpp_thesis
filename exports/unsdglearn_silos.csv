UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner said, “the 2030 Agenda has established anti-corruption as a global imperative on which hinges the achievement of all sustainable development goals. Goal 16 is rooted in human rights and highlights the importance of strengthening institutions and governance in our pledge to leave no one behind. We also have the opportunity to advance the anti-corruption agenda through the implementation of the UN Convention Against Corruption, which has now reached near-universal ratification, providing a comprehensive global framework to fight corruption in alignment with the 2030 Agenda. Corruption is a complex challenge that continues to persist in many countries across the world. It has a direct impact on the three dimensions of sustainable development – social, economic and environmental – and affects each of the five pillars of the 2030 agenda: people, planet, prosperity, peace and partnerships.”
Despite progress made, corruption is still a pressing challenge. Resources lost through corruption exceed the estimated 10 trillion dollars required to eradicate poverty by 2030. Money lost to corruption is essentially development denied to those most at risk of being left behind.

The complex and aspirational 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), require multidisciplinary methods for developing implementation strategies because of their “indivisible whole” nature. Furthermore, the 17 Sustainable Development Goals and their targets are closely interlinked and require innovative and unconventional policy approaches, such as those focusing on the intersections (meeting points), interlinkages and complex causal relationships. This e-Learning course deals with the aspects of ’Why’ and ‘How’ of integration and ESCAP methodologies and tools to aid integrated and interlinked policy making process.
The course consists of three modules, which give insights on the importance of the integration of the three dimensions of sustainable development, and provide further guidance on available tools and their application for policy making and implementation.
The first module on Integration of the Three Dimensions of Sustainable Development is based on the UN ESCAP publication with correlating title – Integrating the three dimensions of sustainable development: A framework and tools. The module defines and articulates to policy makers the essence of integration of the three dimensions of sustainable developmentnamely economic, social and environmental, across the policy cycle.
The second module on Systems Thinking Framework to Support the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development and the SDGs provides an overview of systems thinking methodology and school of thought, a step-by-step guide to systems thinking modelling and examples of application in countries of the Asia-Pacific region. The module also briefly introduces the ESCAP experience in applying systems thinking to SDG integration analysis and provides examples and case studies from contributing partners.
The third module on ESCAP’s Methodology for Applying Systems Thinking in Asia-Pacific Countries for Integrating SDG 6 into National Planning describes the practical application of the ESCAP analytical framework for integration of SDG 6 on Clean Water and Sanitation with the other 16 SDGs at the target level and builds on the Analytical Framework for Integration of Water and Sanitation SDGs and Targets Using Systems Thinking Approach. The module also describes the practical application of the methodology in pilot countries and lessons learned.

Among the priorities agreed upon by member states is social protection — cited in the agenda as a primary means to protect all individuals and families against social contingencies and market risks across the life-cycle. Countries are called on to “implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors, and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable.”
Currently, an estimated 69.4 per cent of the world’s population lives without adequate social protection coverage, including lack of access to a pension, unemployment benefits, health insurance, and income guarantees.
According to the International Labour Organization, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has simultaneously, “exposed deep-seated inequalities and significant gaps in social protection coverage, comprehensiveness and adequacy across all countries” and, “provoked an unparalleled social protection policy response”. It is therefore time to accelerate the transformation of social protection systems in light of the pandemic, to ensure human-centred recovery and resilience.
The ambitious objectives of the 2030 Agenda and the newfound drive for building comprehensive social protection systems will require concerted efforts from across the spectrum of UN and national actors, joining up disparate interventions and leveraging new tools to build enhanced social protection programmes and achieve the 2030 target.
									, The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) lay out a set of key development objectives for developed and developing countries alike to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all., Among the priorities agreed upon by member states is social protection — cited in the agenda as a primary means to protect all individuals and families against social contingencies and market risks across the life-cycle. Countries are called on to “implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors, and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable.”, Currently, an estimated 69.4 per cent of the world’s population lives without adequate social protection coverage, including lack of access to a pension, unemployment benefits, health insurance, and income guarantees., According to the International Labour Organization, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has simultaneously, “exposed deep-seated inequalities and significant gaps in social protection coverage, comprehensiveness and adequacy across all countries” and, “provoked an unparalleled social protection policy response”. It is therefore time to accelerate the transformation of social protection systems in light of the pandemic, to ensure human-centred recovery and resilience., The ambitious objectives of the 2030 Agenda and the newfound drive for building comprehensive social protection systems will require concerted efforts from across the spectrum of UN and national actors, joining up disparate interventions and leveraging new tools to build enhanced social protection programmes and achieve the 2030 target., 
					Target audience
					Participants will represent various backgrounds and will have different levels of experience with working on social protection. Their work will span civil society, academia, the private sector, mass media, political parties, governments, NGOs, international organizations, donors, social workers, educators, volunteers, and influencers. We are looking for motivated people who do not necessarily have prior knowledge about social protection but who can demonstrate they will use the knowledge gained to benefit others.

Such approaches do not adequately consider externalities and their impact on society, equity or the environment. They also often ignore the transboundary and inter-generational effects which results in siloed, contradictory policies that can undermine one another.
This course explores ways to uncover system interconnections and foster integration across the Sustainable Development Goals, against a backdrop of political economy analysis. It explores the concept of systems thinking, as well as a cross-organizational and cross-sectoral policy coherence at the national, regional and international levels. It aims at equipping participants with an understanding of why a focus on system interconnections is key for achieving sustainable development, what coherent policymaking entails, and what are some specific tools, mechanisms and approaches that can be employed to foster both. This need for a systemic and coherence view is more evident than ever as the global COVID-19 pandemic has interrupted our journey towards transformative change and risks reversing decades of development gains.
